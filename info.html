                    <h3>What is <span class="yellow">sub</span> > <span class="black">txt</span> ?</h3>
                    <p>This tool allows you to convert subtitle files of the two most popular softsub formats <i>.srt</i> and <i>.ass</i> to easy to read text. <br> It makes as much use of the available information as possible, as it includes timestamps and actors (if available). <br> The converted files can easily be navigated through the webpage (with buttons on the side of the page), but the user also has the ability to download it as a <i>.txt</i> file or copy it to their clipboard. </p>

                    <h3>Why is <span class="yellow">sub</span> > <span class="black">txt</span>?</h3>
                    <p>This tool is created for situations where you are looking for a specific scene in a movie or show, but are having trouble doing so. With this tool, you can convert the subtitle file(s) of the movie or show and find the scene with the help of CTRL+F and the timestamps. <br>  This tool can also be used if you just want to read through the script of a movie or show, or any other situation where you might want access to the content of a subtitle file.</p>

                    <h3>Where can I find subtitle files?</h3>
                    <p>Subtitles for a movie or show can often be found by searching on Google with a search term like "[TITLE] subtitles". A popular website for downloading subtitle files is <a href="https://www.opensubtitles.org/" target="_blank">opensubtitles.org</a>. <br> Be sure to extract the subtitle file(s) from the <i>.zip</i> file before converting them! <i>.zip</i> support might be implemented in the future. </p>

                    <h3>How do I extract the subtitle file from a <i>.mkv</i> video file?</h3>
                    <p>To do this I recommend using a tool called <a href="https://www.videohelp.com/software/MKVToolNix" target="_blank">MKVToolNix</a>. It's highly recommended to also install the GUI for MKVToolNix, <a href="https://www.videohelp.com/software/MKVcleaver" target="_blank">MKVcleaver</a>.</p>

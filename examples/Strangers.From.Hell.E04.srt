1
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:45,122
(All places, names, organizations, groups...)

2
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:47,992
(and religions in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:57,771
Try this. It's delicious.

4
00:00:58,002 --> 00:00:59,042
Okay.

5
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:07,881
The landlady made this. Try it.

6
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:09,682
Okay.

7
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:25,131
I don't know if it's because I just saw a dead cat,

8
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:27,201
but it tastes weird.

9
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,602
I guess it's not your cup of tea.

10
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:34,701
Well... It's not.

11
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:40,042
I guess you're not into this part.

12
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,712
- What? - I have other parts. You want some?

13
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:48,421
It's late. Why don't we just drink and go in?

14
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:01,671
That's weird. It's some good meat.

15
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:20,751
Why are you so startled?

16
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:24,522
You think this is human meat or something?

17
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:42,342
I'll get going now. I have work tomorrow.

18
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:44,611
Okay.

19
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:47,211
- Goodnight. - Okay.

20
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:07,961
He finally closed his door.

21
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:16,072
I guess that pervert listens to the lady at least.

22
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:36,092
That's strange. It's tasty meat.

23
00:03:36,262 --> 00:03:37,861
It's a shame he doesn't know that.

24
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:49,812
Gosh, I guess he's sensitive.

25
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:52,542
It's just my taste.

26
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,951
Should I add some MSG?

27
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:02,521
Then the meat's original taste will disappear.

28
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:05,822
You're right.

29
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:32,822
That's a relief. It's still intact.

30
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:02,111
It's exactly like the photo.

31
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:18,902
What was that expression anyway?

32
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:26,941
(Episode 4: Mental Derangement)

33
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:37,811
Hey, hey.

34
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:39,681
What?

35
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,191
- Back there. - What?

36
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:46,222
Look behind you.

37
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:48,991
Where?

38
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:49,991
Do you want to die?

39
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:53,832
You told me to look behind.

40
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:56,332
- You lunatic. - Drive! Look the other way!

41
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:57,871
Gosh.

42
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:14,722
I'm so scared.

43
00:06:22,861 --> 00:06:25,962
It's not 13 cats.

44
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:26,962
Pardon?

45
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:29,032
I only killed one.

46
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:32,842
Hello.

47
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:37,142
Could you lower the volume?

48
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,412
What? I can't hear you.

49
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:45,011
Please turn down the music.

50
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:46,921
Okay.

51
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,321
What's wrong, ma'am?

52
00:06:53,491 --> 00:06:59,162
Those kids were strange ever since they were born.

53
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:03,801
Your left taillight is out.

54
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:06,272
It's too dangerous to drive around at night like that.

55
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:08,001
Make sure to get it repaired tomorrow.

56
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:09,741
Gosh.

57
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:14,011
I wonder who did that. I'm so upset.

58
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:16,111
Anyway...

59
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:20,181
He said he was scared.

60
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:34,061
Sir.

61
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:37,202
We're going to check the back of your car.

62
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:40,441
Why?

63
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:43,142
I just need to check.

64
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:44,871
I'd appreciate your cooperation.

65
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:57,051
Take a look.

66
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:03,061
That's from food waste.

67
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:14,801
It's dangerous to drive with your taillight out,

68
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:16,311
so please get it repaired tomorrow.

69
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,571
- Okay. - Goodbye, then.

70
00:08:17,972 --> 00:08:20,642
Don't police officers patrol in teams of two?

71
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:23,652
What?

72
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:25,782
You're alone.

73
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:28,621
(Police)

74
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:37,032
My brother and I always move around together.

75
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:56,582
It's you, the BB gun.

76
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:58,251
Can we leave now?

77
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:00,881
- Sure, you may. - Goodbye, ma'am.

78
00:09:01,222 --> 00:09:03,222
Are you going back to the studio?

79
00:09:03,722 --> 00:09:05,422
Yes. Why?

80
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:08,631
Nothing. Goodbye.

81
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:18,232
What's wrong?

82
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:20,972
Nothing, sir.

83
00:09:36,621 --> 00:09:40,922
Gosh, it's already late. I should sleep.

84
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:49,232
That was so funny.

85
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:54,172
Now that the thug is gone, it's their world.

86
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:03,582
Gosh.

87
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:07,281
Anyway, I'm glad I got the plot going.

88
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:10,592
Right. I should write a bit every day.

89
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:20,062
Did the foreigner who used to live here stick those on?

90
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,602
Sergeant Jo?

91
00:10:59,802 --> 00:11:02,141
Sergeant Jo, what are you doing there?

92
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:20,521
Would you like some?

93
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:21,761
It's human meat.

94
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:16,543
Grandma.

95
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:18,982
Thank you, young lady.

96
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:20,953
I'm going to work now.

97
00:12:28,793 --> 00:12:30,323
- Young lady. - Yes?

98
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:33,232
My husband is nice.

99
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:36,662
Please find my husband.

100
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:38,603
Please find him.

101
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,043
I'll find him.

102
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:46,512
You didn't go to school yet?

103
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,742
I'm too old for school.

104
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:51,242
Good for you, Dad. You're a high school student now.

105
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:52,652
- Are you teasing me? - Yes.

106
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,652
- Go to work. - Okay.

107
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:56,652
- Watch out for cars. - Yes.

108
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:58,423
I'll be back.

109
00:12:59,323 --> 00:13:01,193
Grandma, I'm going to work.

110
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:03,963
Bye.

111
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:05,762
- Be careful. - Okay.

112
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:11,232
That young lady has a very likable face.

113
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:13,502
Of course. She's your granddaughter.

114
00:13:14,103 --> 00:13:17,402
That young lady has a very likable face.

115
00:13:20,642 --> 00:13:23,683
Dr. Seo. Hello.

116
00:13:24,482 --> 00:13:27,152
It's been a while. I guess you've been busy lately.

117
00:13:27,152 --> 00:13:29,423
- Yes. Hello. - I rarely get to see you nowadays.

118
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:32,122
Hello, Se Yeon.

119
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:35,122
She gets shy around people.

120
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:37,723
Bye.

121
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:41,492
By the way, are you available this weekend?

122
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,333
The women's association is going to the nursing home for an event.

123
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,402
No, I mean to volunteer.

124
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:49,603
Just like the other time, will you be up for checking their...

125
00:13:50,803 --> 00:13:52,843
I was wondering if you could check their teeth.

126
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:54,512
Excuse me. Hello?

127
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:59,083
Yes, ma'am. I hope Hak Soo is well.

128
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:00,083
Yes.

129
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:02,953
I'll call you later. Yes.

130
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:05,793
I'm sorry. Will you be available for that?

131
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:09,423
I have another appointment this weekend.

132
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,622
- I'm sorry. - I see.

133
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:13,492
- Help us out next time then. - Sure.

134
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,902
See you around, Se Yeon.

135
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:28,912
You always get shy whenever you see the dentist.

136
00:14:31,683 --> 00:14:33,313
That man is scary.

137
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:47,262
Oh, right.

138
00:14:51,703 --> 00:14:52,933
I should do this every day.

139
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:41,683
Why don't you calm down? We have a newcomer.

140
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:45,853
It didn't look like he was going to leave this place.

141
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:48,892
Darn it.

142
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:57,803
I'll kill you.

143
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,073
What did you say?

144
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,053
Just let it go.

145
00:16:22,563 --> 00:16:24,063
Just let it go.

146
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:27,892
If I take him seriously, I'll stoop to his level.

147
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:38,043
- Hello. - Who are you?

148
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:41,013
- I came by here the other day. - You're that police officer.

149
00:16:41,013 --> 00:16:42,882
- Right. - My goodness.

150
00:16:43,283 --> 00:16:46,712
You look so young without your uniform on.

151
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:48,353
You look so pretty too.

152
00:16:48,353 --> 00:16:49,353
Are you going out?

153
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:51,783
I'm volunteering for senior citizens who live alone today.

154
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:53,722
I see. You're doing a good deed.

155
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:56,722
I guess you had always volunteered at places.

156
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:57,722
Pardon?

157
00:16:58,093 --> 00:17:00,192
It didn't sound like this was your first time.

158
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:04,662
My gosh, is that why?

159
00:17:04,662 --> 00:17:07,202
When I go out, beggars cling onto me.

160
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:11,243
By the way, what brings you here? Are you here to see me?

161
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:14,743
I just wanted to ask you a question.

162
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:17,612
- This man. - I was about to leave.

163
00:17:18,142 --> 00:17:20,182
This is the man who used to live in Unit 303.

164
00:17:21,112 --> 00:17:22,952
You know that this guy went missing, right?

165
00:17:23,182 --> 00:17:25,793
Of course, I was the one who reported him missing.

166
00:17:27,853 --> 00:17:30,093
A man who used to live in this room killed himself.

167
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:32,932
- Missing? He didn't kill himself? - Hey.

168
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:34,563
- Are you going to work? - Yes.

169
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:38,533
So what is it? Did you find him?

170
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:39,803
No. We're still looking for him.

171
00:17:40,273 --> 00:17:41,632
You still haven't found him?

172
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:44,243
Gosh, this is so upsetting.

173
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:46,612
I tried not to bring this up with you.

174
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,513
But don't you think you police are being irresponsible?

175
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:50,912
Gosh, I can't believe you still haven't found him.

176
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,612
That's why I'm trying to investigate this with all of my resources.

177
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:55,412
How can you find him with just your resources?

178
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:58,583
Just send the patrol cars during the night here.

179
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:01,922
Some guys pee all over this place. It's causing me headaches.

180
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:04,462
Young man, why are you still here?

181
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,093
Gosh, were you waiting for me?

182
00:18:07,093 --> 00:18:09,233
No, I forgot something upstairs.

183
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,733
- Hey, I'm late for my appointment. - Yes?

184
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:15,902
- I'll get going now. - Okay.

185
00:18:15,902 --> 00:18:17,202
- Bye. - Call me later.

186
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,412
- Okay. Bye. - Okay? Call me when you find him.

187
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:22,583
Where did he go after leaving all of his stuff?

188
00:18:24,543 --> 00:18:26,253
My gosh. I got nothing.

189
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:31,152
Hello.

190
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:34,853
Hello. We met in front of Eden Studio earlier.

191
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:37,093
- Pardon? - We met earlier.

192
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:38,192
Yes.

193
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:41,093
Right. Can we talk for a second?

194
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:43,603
I'm on my way to work now.

195
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:46,033
That's great. I can give you a ride.

196
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:49,642
- I'll just walk. - It will only take a minute.

197
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:52,343
Please? Here.

198
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,753
I can drop you off at the bus stop, right?

199
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:06,152
Yes. Over there.

200
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:11,962
By the way, how long have you been living at the studio?

201
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:13,692
Four days.

202
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,033
I overheard the conversation earlier.

203
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:20,103
So the foreigner who used to live at the studio went missing?

204
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:23,442
Yes, but everyone seems very nonchalant about it.

205
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:29,513
Was there anybody else that was reported missing?

206
00:19:31,843 --> 00:19:35,353
Did someone from the studio disappear again?

207
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,823
According to the landlady,

208
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:41,122
he did move out of the studio.

209
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:42,793
But it was odd that it was so sudden.

210
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:44,622
And it didn't look like he'd leave any time soon either.

211
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:47,662
Besides, a detective came to the studio a while ago.

212
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,533
- A detective? - Yes.

213
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:55,172
Can I get the detective's number?

214
00:19:56,702 --> 00:19:58,202
His business card...

215
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:01,642
I did get his business card, but it's at my office.

216
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:02,783
I'll give it to you later.

217
00:20:02,783 --> 00:20:06,412
Okay. Here's my number.

218
00:20:06,753 --> 00:20:09,013
I'd really appreciate it if you call me.

219
00:20:13,853 --> 00:20:14,922
Please give me a call.

220
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:18,823
- Bye. - Bye.

221
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:19,833
Okay.

222
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,702
How nice.

223
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:29,942
It looks like your ancestor had lived a virtuous life.

224
00:20:32,743 --> 00:20:35,872
Hello. You have a very likable face.

225
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:39,583
It looks like your ancestor had lived a virtuous life.

226
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:45,523
You must be new to the neighborhood.

227
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:50,263
Hello, ma'am.

228
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:53,333
Your face is glowing.

229
00:20:53,593 --> 00:20:55,932
It looks like your ancestor had lived a virtuous life.

230
00:20:56,503 --> 00:20:59,733
Do you live in the neighborhood? You must be going somewhere nice.

231
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:08,212
Is there something on my face?

232
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,083
No.

233
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:15,853
Do you really think my face is glowing?

234
00:21:16,222 --> 00:21:17,853
That's fascinating.

235
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,493
Of course.

236
00:21:20,952 --> 00:21:25,962
By the way, don't you have a lot of sick people around you lately?

237
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,132
My gosh, how did you know that?

238
00:21:28,392 --> 00:21:30,263
You really are something else!

239
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:36,872
Let's not talk about this on the street. Why don't we...

240
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:39,442
go to a cafe nearby and discuss it over a cup of tea?

241
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:42,543
You know what? Let's not do that. Let's go to my house.

242
00:21:42,813 --> 00:21:44,543
It's just over the hill.

243
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:46,753
I'll serve you a nice cup of tea.

244
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:48,382
Really?

245
00:21:49,622 --> 00:21:51,323
So I wasn't mistaken.

246
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:54,422
You really are a generous woman.

247
00:21:55,122 --> 00:21:57,622
Let's go to my house and tell me all about it. Okay?

248
00:21:57,622 --> 00:21:59,892
- Sure. - Come with me.

249
00:21:59,892 --> 00:22:02,063
You're really gifted.

250
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:07,402
Thank you. Goodbye.

251
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:17,182
(I'm near Daehangno on business and want to...)

252
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:20,083
(drop by and see you. Are you free?)

253
00:22:45,142 --> 00:22:47,472
(Ji Eun)

254
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:50,013
(I'm on the way. Fourth floor, right?)

255
00:22:53,612 --> 00:22:55,612
(I'm on the way. Fourth floor, right?)

256
00:22:55,612 --> 00:22:57,353
(Ji Eun, wait...)

257
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:00,753
(Ji Eun, wait, I'll come...)

258
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:03,263
Hey.

259
00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:05,722
- Wow. - It's been a while.

260
00:23:05,722 --> 00:23:07,533
- You got so pretty. - What?

261
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:08,733
Come here.

262
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:10,263
- Say hi. - Hello.

263
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,632
This is Jong Woo's girlfriend I mentioned.

264
00:23:13,073 --> 00:23:14,233
Isn't she pretty?

265
00:23:14,773 --> 00:23:16,872
Everyone is at that age.

266
00:23:16,872 --> 00:23:18,872
Come on, sir.

267
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:20,743
Yu Jung's pretty too.

268
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:22,573
You're even prettier.

269
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:23,583
Really?

270
00:23:23,743 --> 00:23:26,152
Yes, well, Yu Jung performed on stage.

271
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:28,753
Don't mind us and get to work.

272
00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:30,853
Come here, have a coffee.

273
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:34,293
No, thanks. I have to go. I just dropped by to see him.

274
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,862
We haven't met since he moved to Seoul.

275
00:23:36,862 --> 00:23:37,993
Really?

276
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:39,733
Don't work him too hard.

277
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,632
What do you think I... Hey, tell her.

278
00:23:42,632 --> 00:23:43,862
He's nice to me.

279
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:45,932
- See? - As if.

280
00:23:45,932 --> 00:23:48,233
I really have to go. I'll call.

281
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,243
Can't you stay for a coffee?

282
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:52,702
I really only came by to see Jong Woo.

283
00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:54,273
I have a boss to tiptoe around too.

284
00:23:54,273 --> 00:23:56,283
You're in the premier league.

285
00:23:56,283 --> 00:23:58,283
Look at us. We're a neighborhood team.

286
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:00,783
I could lose my job any day. Bye.

287
00:24:02,212 --> 00:24:04,652
Can I go downstairs to see her off?

288
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,652
Actually, I'd like to...

289
00:24:06,652 --> 00:24:09,053
Don't even ask. See her off.

290
00:24:09,053 --> 00:24:10,622
Okay then. Let's go.

291
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:13,192
Wait, wait.

292
00:24:17,233 --> 00:24:19,103
Good for you, Jong Woo.

293
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:21,632
You have a girlfriend and all.

294
00:24:22,702 --> 00:24:25,672
I'm jealous. Darn it.

295
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:27,073
I missed your text.

296
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:28,472
I didn't call.

297
00:24:28,472 --> 00:24:29,612
Walk in the shade.

298
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:31,513
Actually...

299
00:24:33,053 --> 00:24:34,452
This is for you.

300
00:24:34,652 --> 00:24:36,523
- What is it? - It's...

301
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:40,323
I went to have my laptop fixed and they were doing a lucky draw.

302
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:42,053
I threw a dart.

303
00:24:42,053 --> 00:24:43,362
This is actually...

304
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:45,293
the worst prize they had.

305
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,533
But... But...

306
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:48,593
It suited you.

307
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:50,632
Okay, fine.

308
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:52,533
You said you'd walk me to give me this?

309
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,533
That too.

310
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,533
How cute.

311
00:24:54,972 --> 00:24:56,603
I'll hang it on my bag. Thanks.

312
00:24:56,603 --> 00:24:57,702
Sure.

313
00:24:57,843 --> 00:25:00,912
Oh, that guy in the corner. Is he your mentor?

314
00:25:00,972 --> 00:25:02,142
Yes.

315
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,112
He was really weird.

316
00:25:04,112 --> 00:25:06,412
- Was he? - He didn't even say hi.

317
00:25:06,412 --> 00:25:08,182
- I was so embarrassed. - I see.

318
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:10,422
- Can we meet this weekend? - So...

319
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:11,722
We should.

320
00:25:11,722 --> 00:25:14,053
- Okay. I have to go. - Wait.

321
00:25:14,053 --> 00:25:15,753
There's a taxi. Take that.

322
00:25:19,462 --> 00:25:20,493
Thanks.

323
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:22,862
- Call me. - Okay.

324
00:25:22,862 --> 00:25:24,563
Bye. Take care.

325
00:25:51,622 --> 00:25:55,263
Am I too tired because I didn't sleep? I'm seeing things.

326
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:02,372
Jong Woo.

327
00:26:03,702 --> 00:26:06,843
Ji Eun looks like she's in heat, doesn't she?

328
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:07,872
What?

329
00:26:09,743 --> 00:26:12,382
I mean I think she likes you a lot.

330
00:26:12,882 --> 00:26:13,983
Jae Ho.

331
00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:18,083
Don't talk like that about Ji Eun.

332
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:20,222
It's offensive.

333
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:26,862
Don't get so worked up about a joke.

334
00:26:29,093 --> 00:26:30,263
Yu Jung.

335
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:32,932
Do you think I went too far?

336
00:26:36,603 --> 00:26:37,872
You, Sang Man?

337
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:39,043
Pardon?

338
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:42,642
Yes, Jong Woo, you overreacted.

339
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,182
It was just a joke.

340
00:26:44,182 --> 00:26:45,343
Right?

341
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:49,622
See? You're the only one acting up.

342
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:53,753
See? I told you he's weird.

343
00:26:56,253 --> 00:26:57,793
You're weird.

344
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,733
Let's go out for lunch.

345
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:05,003
The lunatics.

346
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:06,233
Here.

347
00:27:07,432 --> 00:27:10,573
This is all I have to offer my special guest.

348
00:27:10,573 --> 00:27:12,803
It's fine. Thank you.

349
00:27:12,803 --> 00:27:15,972
Who is this lady?

350
00:27:15,972 --> 00:27:17,783
Hello.

351
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:20,152
I met her on the street.

352
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:22,152
She's very smart.

353
00:27:22,952 --> 00:27:26,922
I brought her over to ask her a few things.

354
00:27:28,353 --> 00:27:29,892
Do you want to join us?

355
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:32,192
Sit down.

356
00:27:34,162 --> 00:27:37,862
You can speak freely.

357
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:41,372
What do you see in him?

358
00:27:42,432 --> 00:27:44,303
This should be fun.

359
00:27:47,813 --> 00:27:50,513
Your ear is split in two.

360
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,353
I see someone else.

361
00:27:54,452 --> 00:27:56,152
A brother or a sister?

362
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:58,452
My gosh. That's amazing.

363
00:27:59,793 --> 00:28:03,622
See? I told you she's very good.

364
00:28:03,622 --> 00:28:05,862
Tell me something else.

365
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,132
You'll have an unfortunate year.

366
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:15,603
An unfortunate year.

367
00:28:15,603 --> 00:28:17,472
- That's bad. - What's that?

368
00:28:17,472 --> 00:28:18,702
What is that?

369
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:20,642
It means bad luck.

370
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:25,343
Stay away from me.

371
00:28:25,343 --> 00:28:27,452
Your bad luck might rub off on me.

372
00:28:27,452 --> 00:28:30,622
Are you saying I'll have rotten luck?

373
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:34,222
It's not that. It's...

374
00:28:34,222 --> 00:28:38,093
It's because of your sins and bad karma.

375
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,293
If you pray with us...

376
00:28:40,563 --> 00:28:43,362
I sinned? Is that it?

377
00:28:43,362 --> 00:28:46,362
You sinned. That's bad.

378
00:28:48,172 --> 00:28:51,372
You said you're good at reading fortunes.

379
00:28:51,372 --> 00:28:54,073
Then tell me. Is it a man...

380
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:57,243
or a woman?

381
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:58,783
What?

382
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:01,912
The person you talked about earlier...

383
00:29:02,353 --> 00:29:04,553
that you said you could see.

384
00:29:08,952 --> 00:29:12,063
I think it's a man.

385
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:18,462
Then... Then...

386
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:22,573
is that person older or younger than me?

387
00:29:28,773 --> 00:29:31,382
Younger, maybe?

388
00:29:35,212 --> 00:29:36,983
Wrong!

389
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:41,053
You didn't get anything right.

390
00:29:56,902 --> 00:29:58,303
I should go.

391
00:30:04,912 --> 00:30:06,112
Stop.

392
00:30:08,983 --> 00:30:12,122
This lady's weird.

393
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:18,763
Lady. Do you know why so many people around me are sick?

394
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:20,362
What?

395
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,692
It's because I make them sick.

396
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:24,563
Didn't you know?

397
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:28,472
Don't hurt me.

398
00:30:28,472 --> 00:30:32,043
You talk about fortunes when you can't even see your own?

399
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:33,612
Why you...

400
00:30:35,372 --> 00:30:38,642
Last night, a hiker found a body part in a black plastic bag.

401
00:30:38,642 --> 00:30:39,983
What's going on?

402
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:43,952
Some people are worse than dogs.

403
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:45,922
Not even dogs do that.

404
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,853
It's because they don't execute...

405
00:30:47,853 --> 00:30:49,523
Did you see that news a few days ago?

406
00:30:49,523 --> 00:30:51,462
There was a hydrochloric acid attack.

407
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:53,392
- Yes, I heard. - They caught the guy.

408
00:30:53,432 --> 00:30:55,632
Must you talk about that during lunch?

409
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:56,833
Just listen.

410
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,362
The criminal was the CEO of a small company.

411
00:30:59,362 --> 00:31:01,432
He made lots of donations...

412
00:31:01,432 --> 00:31:03,803
and had a good reputation and a family.

413
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:05,573
Then what, does a criminal...

414
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,743
have "I'm a killer" on his forehead?

415
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:09,243
That's what I'm saying.

416
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:12,112
Such people look normal on the outside.

417
00:31:12,112 --> 00:31:13,142
That's right.

418
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:16,682
I saw a guy get half beaten to death when I met Jong Woo for drinks.

419
00:31:16,682 --> 00:31:18,382
- Really? - Yes.

420
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:21,622
One guy was out of his mind and raining punches.

421
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:24,362
Jong Woo stopped him.

422
00:31:24,692 --> 00:31:26,692
He's quite the psycho himself.

423
00:31:27,162 --> 00:31:28,293
Good for you.

424
00:31:28,632 --> 00:31:30,702
Jong Woo, have some raw beef.

425
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,733
You probably don't get this at the studio.

426
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:34,632
You need the nutrients.

427
00:31:34,632 --> 00:31:36,872
The meat here is amazing.

428
00:31:46,853 --> 00:31:48,412
Are you okay?

429
00:31:49,083 --> 00:31:51,553
He must not feel well.

430
00:31:52,553 --> 00:31:55,053
Did he almost puke at my face?

431
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:57,392
It can't be that.

432
00:31:57,823 --> 00:31:59,493
That's not entirely unlikely.

433
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:02,993
That was mean. I am the CEO, you know.

434
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:04,263
Just eat.

435
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:23,853
I know people like you.

436
00:32:25,382 --> 00:32:29,553
I met someone like you during my military service.

437
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:33,533
They act nice but criticize behind people's back.

438
00:32:33,793 --> 00:32:34,962
If you are trying to win sympathy...

439
00:32:35,493 --> 00:32:37,803
with that pretty face,

440
00:32:39,063 --> 00:32:40,172
it won't work on me.

441
00:32:40,172 --> 00:32:42,503
What are you talking about?

442
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:57,023
Should I kill him?

443
00:33:01,553 --> 00:33:04,063
You should kill him.

444
00:33:11,862 --> 00:33:14,472
I am really annoyed now.

445
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:20,172
By the way, how is our intern doing?

446
00:33:20,813 --> 00:33:22,142
He is not doing much.

447
00:33:22,912 --> 00:33:26,182
Come on. You need to take better care of him.

448
00:33:26,182 --> 00:33:28,152
Think of him as your brother.

449
00:33:28,513 --> 00:33:31,952
I saw him lost like a stray dog once.

450
00:33:32,323 --> 00:33:33,793
He doesn't know anything.

451
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:37,722
Shouldn't he have more experience to be in the field?

452
00:33:39,322 --> 00:33:41,863
That is why you need to teach him.

453
00:33:43,233 --> 00:33:45,702
- Jong Woo, are you okay? - Yes.

454
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:50,443
It breaks my heart that you are sick...

455
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:51,903
when you live in such a horrible studio.

456
00:33:52,543 --> 00:33:53,713
Do you need some fresh air?

457
00:33:55,113 --> 00:33:57,613
That studio does not have a good ventilation system.

458
00:33:57,742 --> 00:33:59,182
There are practically no windows.

459
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,052
Once the air goes in, there's no way out.

460
00:34:05,153 --> 00:34:06,353
Did you finish already?

461
00:34:09,592 --> 00:34:11,863
Why don't you go in first? I need to speak with Jong Woo.

462
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:14,293
What is it? A bromance?

463
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,432
Are you really okay? Do you need to go home early?

464
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:20,603
It's fine. It's just indigestion.

465
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:22,633
How can a young man like you be so weak?

466
00:34:23,032 --> 00:34:25,503
- Does that studio provide dinner? - Jae Ho.

467
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:29,543
Can you not talk about the studio in front of other people?

468
00:34:29,543 --> 00:34:31,943
Why is it dripping so much?

469
00:34:32,742 --> 00:34:34,983
- Why? Are you embarrassed? - No.

470
00:34:35,512 --> 00:34:39,153
- That is how everyone starts. - Just...

471
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:42,552
Can you just not talk about it in front of others?

472
00:34:43,892 --> 00:34:46,892
- What? - You have never lived there.

473
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,802
What kind of attitude is this?

474
00:34:58,372 --> 00:35:01,213
- Sorry. I just don't feel well. - Darn it.

475
00:35:01,912 --> 00:35:03,273
It is too dirty for me to finish.

476
00:35:06,543 --> 00:35:09,552
Yun Jong Woo. Let's be professionals, all right?

477
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:13,083
At work, I am the CEO, and you are just an employee.

478
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,592
Have you ever seen an employee being rude to the CEO?

479
00:35:15,592 --> 00:35:17,162
- You... - I am not trying to be rude...

480
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:19,222
Stop calling my name.

481
00:35:23,863 --> 00:35:26,633
You need to be in better control of your emotions.

482
00:35:29,673 --> 00:35:32,603
There is no point in being nice to people.

483
00:35:42,353 --> 00:35:43,452
Look at this sweat.

484
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:53,392
What is so scary that you have to wet yourself?

485
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:58,202
The deity you trust so much will come and save you.

486
00:35:59,702 --> 00:36:00,733
Isn't that right?

487
00:36:05,673 --> 00:36:07,043
Do you remember me now?

488
00:36:10,613 --> 00:36:13,883
It's me. Bok Soon.

489
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:17,622
The one who ate too much. Eom Bok Soon.

490
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,092
Do you remember now?

491
00:36:33,202 --> 00:36:36,833
I remembered you the moment I saw you.

492
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:40,043
Isn't life so interesting?

493
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,722
Let me take care of my business. Have fun with her.

494
00:36:53,653 --> 00:36:54,693
Later.

495
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:00,963
Shall we begin?

496
00:37:06,903 --> 00:37:10,802
(Cha Sung Ryeol)

497
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:18,983
Hello?

498
00:37:19,813 --> 00:37:23,353
I am the person you met in front of the studio this morning.

499
00:37:23,353 --> 00:37:25,452
Hello, Jong Woo.

500
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:27,653
I just sent a picture of the business card.

501
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:30,293
Thank you.

502
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:35,032
Please check that. I need to get back to work, so...

503
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:36,162
- Hang on. - Sure.

504
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:39,662
If I need anything,

505
00:37:39,662 --> 00:37:42,003
can I call you?

506
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:46,912
Sure. I need to get back to work. I will hang up now.

507
00:37:46,912 --> 00:37:49,642
- Thank you. - Goodbye, Officer.

508
00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:52,742
Officer? Are you in trouble?

509
00:37:53,782 --> 00:37:54,853
It's nothing.

510
00:37:55,452 --> 00:37:57,523
Of course, it is something. I can see it.

511
00:37:57,523 --> 00:37:59,383
- You can talk to me. - It really is nothing.

512
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:04,262
- Let's get back. - Are you still angry?

513
00:38:05,762 --> 00:38:07,592
I can tell it in your voice.

514
00:38:08,963 --> 00:38:12,162
You think we are still in some college clubs? No.

515
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:15,802
I am the CEO that pays you, and you are my employee.

516
00:38:16,103 --> 00:38:17,543
You need to control your emotions better.

517
00:38:18,702 --> 00:38:19,742
Hey.

518
00:38:21,472 --> 00:38:23,443
- Smile. - What?

519
00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:25,142
I said, smile.

520
00:38:28,983 --> 00:38:30,782
Why are you doing this to me, Jae Ho?

521
00:38:30,782 --> 00:38:31,782
Jae Ho?

522
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:35,023
- Mr. Shin. - You think I am joking?

523
00:38:36,853 --> 00:38:38,063
I said smile.

524
00:38:45,662 --> 00:38:46,662
Wait.

525
00:39:01,782 --> 00:39:03,383
Wait. Let's make this work, got it?

526
00:39:03,983 --> 00:39:05,023
Yes, sir.

527
00:39:21,103 --> 00:39:23,133
The person you have called is unavailable right now...

528
00:39:24,972 --> 00:39:26,702
(Cha Sung Ryeol)

529
00:39:29,372 --> 00:39:30,583
(Cha Sung Ryeol)

530
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:43,963
This is Lee Kwang Jae from District Investigation Team.

531
00:39:44,193 --> 00:39:47,432
Hello, my name is Soh Jung Hwa,

532
00:39:47,432 --> 00:39:49,293
an officer of the Eunhye Patrol Division.

533
00:39:49,432 --> 00:39:50,762
Why did you call us?

534
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:52,733
Well...

535
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:56,333
I was hoping to get in touch with Detective Cha Sung Ryeol.

536
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:58,742
His phone is turned off.

537
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:00,443
Detective Cha?

538
00:40:00,872 --> 00:40:03,012
We can't reach him either because he is on vacation.

539
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:04,242
Vacation?

540
00:40:04,313 --> 00:40:06,742
Yes. He didn't pick up our calls for days too.

541
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,552
- Why are you looking for him? - Well...

542
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:12,653
Detective Cha met someone...

543
00:40:12,653 --> 00:40:14,253
at a studio that was within our jurisdiction.

544
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:18,063
And that person is now missing, so I was hoping to talk to him.

545
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:19,622
A studio?

546
00:40:22,363 --> 00:40:24,432
I will pass on the message once I get hold of him.

547
00:40:24,733 --> 00:40:27,833
That will be great. Thank you.

548
00:40:28,233 --> 00:40:29,403
Thank you.

549
00:40:36,613 --> 00:40:38,043
- Give that to me. - Geez!

550
00:40:38,943 --> 00:40:41,483
- Give it to me. - You scared me! You should knock.

551
00:40:41,483 --> 00:40:42,713
Knock, knock. Give it to me.

552
00:40:42,713 --> 00:40:44,583
(Eunhye Patrol Division)

553
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:45,622
Here.

554
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:58,233
Definitely with an engineering background.

555
00:41:00,673 --> 00:41:01,733
A goddess of the engineering department?

556
00:41:02,802 --> 00:41:04,742
- Mr. Park. - What is it?

557
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:10,043
Before you came here, you were in the Criminal Division, right?

558
00:41:10,043 --> 00:41:11,213
Yes, I was.

559
00:41:11,443 --> 00:41:16,083
If that's the case, what does it mean...

560
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:17,653
when a detective suddenly isn't picking up his calls?

561
00:41:18,122 --> 00:41:19,452
Why do you want to know?

562
00:41:20,122 --> 00:41:23,963
Do you remember the guy who came in because of the dead cat?

563
00:41:23,963 --> 00:41:25,363
With a gun?

564
00:41:25,592 --> 00:41:26,923
- BB gun? - Yes.

565
00:41:26,923 --> 00:41:29,592
Two people went missing...

566
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:31,003
from his studio.

567
00:41:31,003 --> 00:41:33,702
And a detective who was on his way to meet one of them...

568
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,802
is now no longer picking up his calls.

569
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:36,932
Isn't it strange?

570
00:41:40,842 --> 00:41:42,472
That can happen.

571
00:41:43,472 --> 00:41:47,452
Some detectives, when they are into a case,

572
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,012
they might be unreachable for some time.

573
00:41:51,222 --> 00:41:54,293
He will resurface again a few days later.

574
00:41:54,622 --> 00:41:55,693
I don't think so.

575
00:41:56,322 --> 00:41:59,363
It is really strange. I can really feel it.

576
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:01,233
Just a feeling?

577
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:05,103
How does a newbie just have a feeling?

578
00:42:05,403 --> 00:42:07,103
A patrol division...

579
00:42:07,103 --> 00:42:10,233
isn't a place for investigation.

580
00:42:10,673 --> 00:42:13,943
If you joined the police to investigate, think again.

581
00:42:14,012 --> 00:42:15,412
Don't get all nosy.

582
00:42:15,512 --> 00:42:17,682
Focus on your job.

583
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:22,012
You have some change, right?

584
00:42:22,012 --> 00:42:23,113
Why?

585
00:42:24,452 --> 00:42:25,483
What?

586
00:42:25,822 --> 00:42:27,492
You said that I should just focus on my job.

587
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:29,793
This is for my overtime pay. Thanks.

588
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:32,992
Overtime pay?

589
00:42:33,392 --> 00:42:35,293
That was five dollars!

590
00:42:35,293 --> 00:42:38,662
And I didn't join the police to do investigations.

591
00:42:40,403 --> 00:42:44,302
I joined to help people. I'll get going now.

592
00:42:44,503 --> 00:42:45,702
See you tomorrow.

593
00:42:45,872 --> 00:42:47,342
Funny kid.

594
00:42:50,613 --> 00:42:52,182
Jong Woo, aren't you going home?

595
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:54,552
- I... - Hey,

596
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:57,483
why don't you go on a date with your pretty girlfriend?

597
00:42:57,483 --> 00:43:00,083
I'm seeing her on the weekend. I'll finish up a bit more work.

598
00:43:00,353 --> 00:43:02,193
If anyone saw this,

599
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:04,122
they'd think that you do everything around here.

600
00:43:04,122 --> 00:43:05,793
You're doing that again.

601
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:08,392
- Be kind. - Okay.

602
00:43:08,563 --> 00:43:10,193
Everyone, go home.

603
00:43:10,193 --> 00:43:12,202
Yu Jung, what about a beer after work?

604
00:43:12,202 --> 00:43:14,633
I'm busy today. I'll get going now.

605
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:17,032
I have a family dinner to attend.

606
00:43:17,202 --> 00:43:18,372
See you tomorrow.

607
00:43:22,012 --> 00:43:24,813
All right. Eat dinner with your family.

608
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:27,353
I'm just going to drink alone today.

609
00:43:54,872 --> 00:43:57,583
(Living expenses per month)

610
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,883
I can only save 250 dollars a month even if spend as little as possible.

611
00:44:03,012 --> 00:44:04,782
Goodness.

612
00:44:05,782 --> 00:44:09,492
How am I going to find a new place and move in?

613
00:44:13,092 --> 00:44:14,892
Goodness.

614
00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:22,773
Hey, when does the draft of the poster design come out?

615
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:24,202
The draft copy?

616
00:44:24,202 --> 00:44:27,103
Probably sometime early next month.

617
00:44:27,103 --> 00:44:29,412
- I'll let you know when I find out. - Is that right?

618
00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:33,083
We need to get it done when the actors aren't busy.

619
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:35,552
We need to plan it in advance, so Ji Eun,

620
00:44:35,552 --> 00:44:38,122
please check all the actors' schedules.

621
00:44:39,182 --> 00:44:40,423
Ji Eun?

622
00:44:44,122 --> 00:44:45,523
Ji Eun!

623
00:44:46,363 --> 00:44:48,133
What are you thinking about?

624
00:44:48,563 --> 00:44:50,702
Why are you zoning out?

625
00:44:50,702 --> 00:44:52,503
I asked you to check on all the actors' schedules.

626
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:54,103
Yes, ma'am.

627
00:44:54,273 --> 00:44:57,273
You were thinking about what to have for dinner tonight, right?

628
00:44:57,372 --> 00:44:58,503
Unbelievable.

629
00:44:59,202 --> 00:45:03,173
Ji Eun loves eating, don't you think so?

630
00:45:04,512 --> 00:45:06,512
You heard it, right? We need to film the draft,

631
00:45:06,512 --> 00:45:08,182
so please check and coordinate with the actors' schedules.

632
00:45:08,182 --> 00:45:09,713
Yes, I will do that.

633
00:45:09,782 --> 00:45:12,583
And we're grabbing a beer tonight.

634
00:45:14,552 --> 00:45:16,293
Wait, you're meeting your boyfriend.

635
00:45:16,293 --> 00:45:18,793
No, I'm free tonight.

636
00:45:18,892 --> 00:45:20,992
Is that so? Join us then.

637
00:45:20,992 --> 00:45:22,032
Sure, sounds good.

638
00:45:22,032 --> 00:45:24,032
You don't have to come if you're busy.

639
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:30,403
What do I say?

640
00:45:30,903 --> 00:45:32,103
Hello.

641
00:45:33,372 --> 00:45:34,943
We'll get going now.

642
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:36,372
- Okay. - See you tomorrow.

643
00:45:36,372 --> 00:45:38,912
Sorry for everything today.

644
00:45:38,912 --> 00:45:40,242
It's fine. See you tomorrow.

645
00:45:40,242 --> 00:45:41,853
- Bye. - Good night.

646
00:45:42,012 --> 00:45:45,023
I'm sorry you're stuck here because of me.

647
00:45:45,023 --> 00:45:46,653
It's fine.

648
00:45:46,653 --> 00:45:48,722
You look quite tired as well.

649
00:45:48,722 --> 00:45:51,023
There's just so much work to do lately.

650
00:45:51,023 --> 00:45:54,193
Cats dying, people missing...

651
00:45:54,193 --> 00:45:56,563
Sorry, I'm talking too much.

652
00:45:56,563 --> 00:45:58,133
- Sorry. - It's fine, you can sit down.

653
00:45:58,133 --> 00:45:59,202
Okay.

654
00:46:00,363 --> 00:46:02,302
So someone keeps killing cats?

655
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:03,972
Exactly.

656
00:46:04,302 --> 00:46:07,403
What kind of a person treats stray cats like that?

657
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:10,912
Once, I read in a book...

658
00:46:11,412 --> 00:46:13,512
that murderers apparently...

659
00:46:13,512 --> 00:46:16,253
begin off with murdering animals first.

660
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,483
It might not be just a mean joke.

661
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:21,592
Do you think so too?

662
00:46:22,492 --> 00:46:25,063
Why? Are you suspecting anyone?

663
00:46:26,293 --> 00:46:29,262
I can't pinpoint a particular person.

664
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:32,333
The people at the studio seem quite suspicious, though.

665
00:46:33,932 --> 00:46:37,233
Sorry, I'm talking too much again.

666
00:46:39,943 --> 00:46:41,342
Look at me.

667
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:43,773
Sorry, I forgot to bring your patient chart.

668
00:46:43,872 --> 00:46:45,282
- Hold on. - Okay.

669
00:46:58,892 --> 00:46:59,992
(Yu Spring Dentist)

670
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:26,753
- Hi. - Jung Hwa,

671
00:47:26,753 --> 00:47:29,122
you know the surveillance camera that we tracked and downloaded?

672
00:47:29,122 --> 00:47:31,392
I need to get my hands on that and watch it.

673
00:47:31,392 --> 00:47:33,693
I was wondering if you could grab it for me.

674
00:47:33,693 --> 00:47:34,833
Right now?

675
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:37,333
Yes, I'm in a rush. Where are you?

676
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:38,403
I'm at the dentist right now.

677
00:47:38,403 --> 00:47:41,333
That's good, you're not too far then.

678
00:47:41,572 --> 00:47:42,733
What about Hyun Oh?

679
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:45,472
He's far away to see his family.

680
00:47:45,802 --> 00:47:47,202
I'm sorry I'm making you work after working hours.

681
00:47:47,202 --> 00:47:49,673
It's fine.

682
00:47:52,813 --> 00:47:56,583
Sorry, I have something to do.

683
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:59,853
I'm sorry I made you stay and I'm leaving.

684
00:47:59,853 --> 00:48:01,622
It's fine, you're a busy person.

685
00:48:01,622 --> 00:48:03,092
Sorry.

686
00:48:03,092 --> 00:48:05,193
But make sure to visit as soon as you feel pain.

687
00:48:05,193 --> 00:48:07,092
Okay, thank you.

688
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,492
- Get home safely. - Thanks.

689
00:48:28,613 --> 00:48:29,912
It's the same.

690
00:49:01,753 --> 00:49:05,523
His legs were thin like sticks. His legs were thinner than mine.

691
00:49:05,782 --> 00:49:08,952
I just don't get it.

692
00:49:09,092 --> 00:49:10,322
But...

693
00:49:10,722 --> 00:49:13,293
Ji Eun, it looks like it's your boyfriend. You can pick up.

694
00:49:13,293 --> 00:49:14,492
It's fine.

695
00:49:14,492 --> 00:49:16,633
Just pick up, don't let it ring.

696
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:19,032
Okay.

697
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:23,173
Whenever I meet new guys...

698
00:49:28,113 --> 00:49:29,242
Hey.

699
00:49:30,742 --> 00:49:32,842
Are you working overtime again?

700
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:35,153
Yes, what about you?

701
00:49:36,653 --> 00:49:37,983
I have a work dinner.

702
00:49:37,983 --> 00:49:40,782
My assistant manager wanted a drink.

703
00:49:42,293 --> 00:49:43,452
I see.

704
00:49:44,392 --> 00:49:47,622
Why do you sound so glum? Did something happen?

705
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:51,403
What is it? Tell me.

706
00:49:52,563 --> 00:49:54,472
Are they talking about me behind my back right now?

707
00:49:54,633 --> 00:49:55,733
What?

708
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:59,103
Nothing. What were you saying?

709
00:50:04,742 --> 00:50:06,383
Ji Eun,

710
00:50:06,983 --> 00:50:09,653
you know the studio that I'm staying at?

711
00:50:09,713 --> 00:50:12,222
The people here are weird.

712
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:16,092
One guy keeps stammering and bickering.

713
00:50:16,092 --> 00:50:19,693
And another guy keeps cursing at me.

714
00:50:19,992 --> 00:50:22,463
I don't know who it is,

715
00:50:22,463 --> 00:50:24,363
but someone keeps breaking into my room.

716
00:50:26,802 --> 00:50:27,833
Jong Woo,

717
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:31,972
how many of the people who live there do you think are normal?

718
00:50:32,642 --> 00:50:36,572
It'll only tire you out to act so sensitively to them.

719
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:41,583
Also, I think you should be more firm at work.

720
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:45,353
Did you know that?

721
00:50:45,552 --> 00:50:48,353
Being a kind person isn't a compliment anymore.

722
00:50:50,253 --> 00:50:51,563
Okay.

723
00:50:55,092 --> 00:50:57,592
Sorry, I went overboard.

724
00:50:58,762 --> 00:51:00,262
No, you're right.

725
00:51:01,103 --> 00:51:04,173
I guess I'm being overly sensitive.

726
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:07,242
You can head inside, people are waiting for you.

727
00:51:08,113 --> 00:51:09,673
You're not upset, are you?

728
00:51:10,213 --> 00:51:12,483
I'm not.

729
00:51:13,912 --> 00:51:15,983
I'll message you on my way home.

730
00:51:16,682 --> 00:51:18,023
Okay.

731
00:51:32,762 --> 00:51:34,133
There you are!

732
00:51:34,472 --> 00:51:36,302
- Are you coming home now? - Yes.

733
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,633
Come in for a second.

734
00:51:37,633 --> 00:51:39,372
- What? - It won't take long.

735
00:51:43,673 --> 00:51:44,713
Come in.

736
00:51:45,012 --> 00:51:47,813
- Why? - Look at you sweating.

737
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,253
- It's fine. - You need to shower.

738
00:51:49,253 --> 00:51:51,483
Drink this. It'll cool you down.

739
00:51:54,182 --> 00:51:55,452
Why did you call me in here?

740
00:51:55,452 --> 00:51:59,092
I just have a question. Drink up.

741
00:52:00,392 --> 00:52:02,392
- Isn't it good? - What is it?

742
00:52:02,963 --> 00:52:04,392
Well...

743
00:52:05,403 --> 00:52:07,003
- This morning, - Yes?

744
00:52:07,003 --> 00:52:08,633
I saw you talking to that female police officer.

745
00:52:08,633 --> 00:52:10,572
Is something wrong?

746
00:52:14,403 --> 00:52:15,412
This morning?

747
00:52:15,412 --> 00:52:17,713
Yes, did you guys talk about something serious?

748
00:52:18,342 --> 00:52:19,483
Something serious?

749
00:52:20,242 --> 00:52:21,782
It's nothing much.

750
00:52:22,383 --> 00:52:25,622
But as you know, several of our residents have moved out.

751
00:52:25,883 --> 00:52:27,722
I have to make ends meet, you know?

752
00:52:28,052 --> 00:52:30,952
If weird rumors spread, my business will take a hit.

753
00:52:30,952 --> 00:52:31,992
I see.

754
00:52:32,523 --> 00:52:34,693
- You understand, right? - Of course.

755
00:52:37,063 --> 00:52:38,662
- I should go back in. - All right.

756
00:52:38,662 --> 00:52:40,503
All right. Give that to me.

757
00:52:41,702 --> 00:52:42,872
You must've bought something.

758
00:52:42,872 --> 00:52:45,003
- You should take a shower. - Okay.

759
00:53:03,537 --> 00:53:05,177
How's Unit 303?

760
00:53:05,907 --> 00:53:08,677
Come on. This isn't my first rodeo.

761
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:13,077
The drug is kicking in.

762
00:53:13,477 --> 00:53:14,588
There's nothing to worry about.

763
00:53:16,887 --> 00:53:18,787
Will you take care...

764
00:53:19,688 --> 00:53:21,458
of Unit 303 tonight?

765
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:26,898
That looks tasty. Good luck with that.

766
00:53:27,628 --> 00:53:28,668
Thanks.

767
00:53:31,497 --> 00:53:32,537
Oh, right.

768
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:36,637
- Ma'am. - Yes?

769
00:53:39,177 --> 00:53:41,508
- Why did you do it? - Do what?

770
00:53:43,407 --> 00:53:44,517
The woman on the fourth floor.

771
00:53:47,648 --> 00:53:48,648
What is it?

772
00:53:49,718 --> 00:53:52,588
Are you going to kill me too for being reckless?

773
00:54:06,568 --> 00:54:07,597
Of course, not.

774
00:54:09,438 --> 00:54:10,938
You're special.

775
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:18,677
Try being cooped up in here.

776
00:54:18,778 --> 00:54:20,747
You become raring.

777
00:54:22,747 --> 00:54:25,488
Right. I trust you.

778
00:54:27,617 --> 00:54:28,688
Goodbye.

779
00:54:39,168 --> 00:54:40,798
I should add a lot of MSG.

780
00:54:47,238 --> 00:54:48,778
This feels strange.

781
00:54:50,648 --> 00:54:53,048
Why does my head hurt whenever I come here?

782
00:54:57,148 --> 00:54:58,188
I feel nauseous.

783
00:55:27,517 --> 00:55:29,648
See? I told you.

784
00:55:30,488 --> 00:55:32,488
I told you not to be a show-off!

785
00:55:49,968 --> 00:55:53,508
Kill him. Kill him.

786
00:55:54,477 --> 00:55:58,077
Kill him. Kill him.

787
00:55:58,818 --> 00:56:01,077
- Shut it, you scumbag! - Kill him.

788
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:08,287
Jong Woo,

789
00:56:08,988 --> 00:56:11,827
how many of the people who live there do you think are normal?

790
00:56:12,997 --> 00:56:16,798
It'll only tire you out to act so sensitively to them.

791
00:56:17,697 --> 00:56:19,898
- Kill him. - Also, I think you should be...

792
00:56:19,898 --> 00:56:22,068
- Kill him. - more firm at work.

793
00:56:22,807 --> 00:56:26,238
If you are trying to win sympathy with that pretty face,

794
00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:28,247
Being a kind person isn't a compliment anymore.

795
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:30,247
it won't work on me.

796
00:56:30,247 --> 00:56:31,447
- Kill him. - Being a kind person...

797
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:32,648
isn't a compliment anymore.

798
00:56:32,648 --> 00:56:33,977
Kill him.

799
00:56:34,548 --> 00:56:36,447
- Kill him. - Did you know?

800
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:38,657
Being a kind person isn't a compliment anymore.

801
00:56:38,657 --> 00:56:41,988
Being a kind person isn't a compliment anymore.

802
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:05,818
Am I having indigestion?

803
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,048
I feel so exhausted.

804
00:57:15,988 --> 00:57:18,298
Did something ruin my mood today?

805
00:57:35,477 --> 00:57:37,148
Did I take drugs?

806
00:57:37,648 --> 00:57:39,077
What's wrong with my body?

807
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:50,787
What's going on?

808
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:54,458
What could it be all of a sudden?

809
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:51,758
(Stranger from Hell)

810
00:58:52,017 --> 00:58:54,458
Ma'am, I think someone broke into my room.

811
00:58:54,458 --> 00:58:56,727
Come out. Come out right now!

812
00:58:56,727 --> 00:58:59,358
I think you've become strange ever since you came to Seoul.

813
00:58:59,497 --> 00:59:01,157
Is something going on at the studio?

814
00:59:01,157 --> 00:59:04,128
Did anything else happen at the studio?

815
00:59:04,468 --> 00:59:05,938
The fourth floor...

816
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,597
I just heard a noise from this floor.

817
00:59:07,597 --> 00:59:09,938
Ever since the fire, no one has been living on the fourth floor.

818
00:59:09,938 --> 00:59:13,177
You think you're not suited for this place, right?

819
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:15,378
Unit 303 seems to be meeting...

820
00:59:15,378 --> 00:59:17,708
with that policewoman often.

821
00:59:17,708 --> 00:59:18,778
Are you okay?

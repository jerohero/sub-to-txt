CRASH LANDING ON YOU

HYUN-BIN

00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:37,748
SON YE-JIN

00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:45,736
SEO JI-HYE - KIM JUNG-HYUN

5
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:56,778
CRASH LANDING ON YOU

6
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,775
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

7
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,460
Life

8
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:11,629
is full of surprises.

9
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:16,308
You can't be sure of anything in life.

10
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:13,573
Just tell him what I told you to say.

11
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:22,666
<i>Hello?</i>

12
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:27,921
-It's me.
-<i>Where are you?</i>

13
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:29,839
<i>Why did you call? Just come home.</i>

14
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:33,134
<i>By the way, whose phone is this?</i>

15
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:36,680
I'm leaving now.

16
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,723
<i>To where?</i>

17
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:42,644
Come on.

18
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:46,439
I told you already that I'll be leaving
with Gu Seung-jun.

19
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,316
<i>You'll be leaving right now?</i>

20
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:50,569
Yes.

21
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:52,779
It turned out that way.

22
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:55,115
I'm leaving sooner than expected.

23
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:57,742
<i>Where are you right now? I'll be there.</i>

24
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:00,287
No.

25
00:03:00,495 --> 00:03:03,081
I've already left in a car.

26
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:05,875
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:06,334 --> 00:03:08,378
I left without even saying goodbye to you.

28
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:14,175
But we've said goodbye many times,
you know.

29
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,636
So saying it one more time
might be pointless.

30
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,929
<i>You're wrong.</i>

31
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:19,431
<i>I know we've said it</i>

32
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:21,891
<i>many times before, but we still need
to say our last goodbyes.</i>

33
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,477
<i>We do need to say it again.</i>

34
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,521
<i>So tell me where you are right now.</i>

35
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:27,606
Don't hang up!

36
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:29,858
Listen to me.

37
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:32,986
Tell me what you see. I can find you.

38
00:03:43,204 --> 00:03:44,372
Jeong Hyeok.

39
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,417
I love you.

40
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:57,636
Let's go!

41
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:16,446
<i>The person you have reached
is not available.</i>

42
00:04:25,872 --> 00:04:28,249
GU SEUNG-JUN

43
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:38,426
<i>The phone is either turned off or out
of the service area and cannot be reached.</i>

44
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:03,284
<i>Jeong Hyeok? You need to come home now.</i>

45
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:06,162
-My gosh.
-What's going on?

46
00:05:06,246 --> 00:05:07,414
What is happening?

47
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:09,040
There he is.

48
00:05:09,582 --> 00:05:10,709
Jeong Hyeok.

49
00:05:10,792 --> 00:05:13,586
The State Security Department
is searching your house now.

50
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,338
-Gosh.
-I think they're looking for Sam Suk.

51
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:23,138
Are we all thinking the same thing now?

52
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,767
He's fuming mad, but that only makes him
even more attractive.

53
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:29,811
-Exactly.
-Right?

54
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,084
You're here, Ri Jeong Hyeok.

55
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,421
The higher-ups ordered me to do this.

56
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:59,841
Where did the lady from Division 11 go?

57
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:01,801
We need to take her with us.

58
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,935
-What for?
-I know everything.

59
00:06:12,228 --> 00:06:15,690
That bitch does not belong to Division 11.

60
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:18,068
She is just living proof

61
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:22,139
I can use to completely destroy you,
your father, and your entire family.

62
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:29,797
Making people spill the truth
is my specialty, so don't you worry.

63
00:06:30,872 --> 00:06:32,874
Whether I beat her up to a pulp

64
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,800
or burn her skin with electrical torture,
she'll talk after three or four...

65
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:11,579
I told you

66
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,541
that a thing or a person
is bound to change all the time.

67
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:17,293
You little shit.

68
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,213
You're finished.

69
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,299
Take him.

70
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,560
-My gosh!
-They're taking him?

71
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:35,520
-Captain Ri, are you all right?
-My goodness.

72
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:37,146
-Oh, no.
-Make way!

73
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,190
-Why are they taking him?
-Jeong Hyeok!

74
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:41,901
-My gosh.
-What do we do?

75
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:43,736
Jeong Hyeok! What should we do?

76
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,030
-Gosh!
-My goodness.

77
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:47,991
Gosh, what the heck is happening?

78
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:49,659
Shouldn't we tell them?

79
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:53,162
Can we really let them take him?

80
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:54,455
-What do we do?
-What do we do?

81
00:07:54,664 --> 00:07:56,291
Gosh, Jeong Hyeok!

82
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:14,434
<i>I must pull myself together and focus.</i>

83
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:17,312
<i>Think, whatever it is.</i>

84
00:08:18,396 --> 00:08:20,732
<i>Yes, I should think happy thoughts.</i>

85
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:22,650
<i>Something that makes me happy.</i>

86
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,367
<i>Jeong Hyeok boiling noodles.</i>

87
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:38,207
<i>Jeong Hyeok who didn't know the difference
between candles and scented candles.</i>

88
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:44,631
<i>But now he knows the difference.</i>

89
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:06,778
<i>Jeong Hyeok who covers me with a blanket</i>

90
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:08,947
<i>on his way
to get himself a glass of water.</i>

91
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:12,158
I'll see you off.

92
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,661
-No need.
-All is well.

93
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:17,121
I'll be fine after taking medication
and going to bed.

94
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:19,082
I'm fine.

95
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:21,125
<i>Jeong Hyeok who always lies</i>

96
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,087
<i>and says that he's fine
even though everything is going astray.</i>

97
00:09:25,296 --> 00:09:27,840
Then you'll be safe.
As long as you stay in my sight.

98
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:30,468
Tell me what you see. I can find you.

99
00:09:31,177 --> 00:09:33,888
<i>Does he think he's a superhero or what?</i>

100
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:37,976
<i>He always says that he can do anything
and find me no matter where I am.</i>

101
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,729
<i>Jeong Hyeok likes to talk bullshit
and bluff.</i>

102
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:47,151
I miss you.

103
00:10:49,017 --> 00:10:53,414
CRASH LANDING ON YOU

104
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:11,277
Where am I?

105
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:22,080
Hello? Is anybody there?

106
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:25,958
Is anyone outside? Hello?

107
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:36,219
Right.

108
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:39,555
They wouldn't have locked me up here

109
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:41,891
if they were going to let me out.

110
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:50,608
Some bastards

111
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:53,569
abducted me and locked me up here.

112
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:55,446
Why didn't they kill me?

113
00:11:57,365 --> 00:11:58,491
What are they after?

114
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:07,416
Are they watching me right now?

115
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:19,095
Who are you?

116
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:28,604
RUN AWAY AND YOU DIE!
LET'S BUILD A STRONG SOCIALIST COUNTRY

117
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:36,028
As you probably know,

118
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:39,657
it's not easy for regular soldiers like us
to come here.

119
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,162
But my childhood friend
just so happens to be

120
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:48,624
working as a high-ranking officer
at this detention center.

121
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,044
I don't think he deserves
to take credit for it though.

122
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:53,171
I agree.

123
00:12:53,254 --> 00:12:54,839
I mean, whose fault is it to begin with?

124
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:57,216
Dan's mother came by the other day.

125
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,471
Master Sergeant Pyo got drunk that day
and told her everything about Se-ri.

126
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:08,686
I mean, not everything about her.

127
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,148
I heard her mother is a rich businesswoman
who owns a department store in Pyongyang.

128
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:16,194
Maybe she hired some people to track
Se-ri down and did something to her.

129
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:19,363
Hey, no way.

130
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:21,908
I've seen it so many times
in those South Korean dramas.

131
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:25,119
When someone interferes
with their kid's wedding,

132
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:29,248
the rich in the South either splash water
on that person's face or give money.

133
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:34,128
But the rich here are tougher,

134
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:37,632
so maybe she abducted her
to teach her a lesson.

135
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:43,026
Captain Ri, that lady didn't seem like
she could do such a thing.

136
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,015
I'm warning you.

137
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,310
Don't do anything you're going to regret.

138
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:51,395
Comrades.

139
00:13:51,938 --> 00:13:54,023
I need you to do something for me.

140
00:13:56,025 --> 00:13:57,151
Only after getting locked up,

141
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:00,279
you called me and said
you wanted to see me

142
00:14:01,447 --> 00:14:02,698
for the first time ever.

143
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:08,079
That woman is gone.

144
00:14:10,373 --> 00:14:11,249
So?

145
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:13,876
You must know something about it.

146
00:14:16,128 --> 00:14:17,171
Who did it?

147
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:19,048
Where was she taken to?

148
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:21,217
And is she

149
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:23,970
-okay?
-How ridiculous.

150
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:27,014
Your wedding is in a few days,

151
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:30,017
but you're worried about another woman.

152
00:14:30,518 --> 00:14:32,478
You look as if you've lost everything.

153
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:36,315
This is actually good.

154
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:42,145
You should stay locked up here
until the day of our wedding

155
00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:45,032
and just come out on that day.

156
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,326
I'll see you then.

157
00:14:48,202 --> 00:14:49,370
Is it my father?

158
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,798
You told me
not to do anything I'll regret.

159
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,719
Whom did you ask for help
to make me regret my actions?

160
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,180
It can't be the State Security Department.

161
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,142
And there's no way your mother did it.

162
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:13,853
Did you

163
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:15,938
meet my father?

164
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:19,525
Did my father

165
00:15:21,444 --> 00:15:24,280
-take her? That woman--
-That's right. She's dead.

166
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:26,866
You won't ever find her.

167
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:29,327
So you should just give up.

168
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,747
Go and tell my father.

169
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:36,792
If he hurts or harms her in any way,

170
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:39,712
he'll lose even the only son he has left
for good.

171
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:43,466
You'd better tell him.

172
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,110
IDEOLOGICAL DISCIPLINE

173
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:13,996
Should I have gone in with you?

174
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:15,873
How's Jeong Hyeok holding up?

175
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:19,794
Director Ri doesn't know
about this yet, right?

176
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:23,255
How did he end up in the detention center?

177
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,758
-He'll be furious when he finds out.
-Just leave him.

178
00:16:27,134 --> 00:16:28,010
What?

179
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:30,888
Hey, your wedding
is just around the corner.

180
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,307
I have to keep him there

181
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:37,019
to marry him.

182
00:16:37,603 --> 00:16:39,980
I'm not following at all.
Can you elaborate?

183
00:16:48,948 --> 00:16:49,990
U Pil.

184
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:52,618
-Dad.
-Gosh.

185
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,321
What brings you here?

186
00:16:57,957 --> 00:17:02,525
Yesterday, some men came
and took that pretty lady from the South.

187
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:06,632
And she dropped this.

188
00:18:04,023 --> 00:18:04,940
U Pil.

189
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:07,234
Have you shown this to anyone else?

190
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:11,363
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?

191
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:12,531
Okay, Dad.

192
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:15,201
Will she be okay though?

193
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:27,588
They say you never know
what someone is really thinking.

194
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:30,758
We've known him for a long time.
I can't believe he fooled us all along.

195
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:33,177
I don't understand Captain Ri.

196
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:37,556
He's not the type
to brag about his family background.

197
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,767
-Exactly.
-Still.

198
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:43,229
This is huge news.
How could he keep it from us?

199
00:18:43,896 --> 00:18:47,149
Captain Ri's father is the Director
of the General Political Bureau?

200
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:50,569
I still can't believe it.

201
00:18:50,736 --> 00:18:53,072
Director Ri
won't sit still if he finds out

202
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:56,367
that his dear son is locked up
in the detention center.

203
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,077
Shouldn't we tell him?

204
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,456
Captain Ri told us not to tell anyone,

205
00:19:02,957 --> 00:19:03,999
so keep your lips sealed.

206
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:05,417
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

207
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,335
Let's go.

208
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:25,813
Everyone probably heard it, right?

209
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:28,941
I think you were a little too quiet.

210
00:19:29,024 --> 00:19:31,569
It'd look suspicious
if we were chatting about it loudly.

211
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:34,947
But will that be enough
for the word to spread?

212
00:19:35,364 --> 00:19:36,615
Hey.

213
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:40,828
You don't need 100 bees
to get 100 flowers to bloom.

214
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:45,833
It will only take half a day
for it to reach everyone in this area.

215
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:48,669
But the problem is,

216
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,090
whether or not it's true.

217
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:55,134
There's something else I need you to do.

218
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:58,596
Spread rumors about my family background,

219
00:19:59,722 --> 00:20:01,390
that my father is the Director

220
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:04,351
of the General Political Bureau.

221
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:13,444
I don't think he'll get me out of here
even if he finds out that I'm here.

222
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:17,698
I want to spread rumors to find a way
to get out, so I need your help.

223
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:22,161
I told you.

224
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:24,538
He must've hurt his head when he got shot.

225
00:20:24,622 --> 00:20:26,081
Don't worry, Master Sergeant Pyo.

226
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,167
All of it is true.

227
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:31,128
I don't have time.

228
00:20:31,211 --> 00:20:34,840
The rumors must reach the Senior Colonel
as quickly as possible.

229
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,219
His father is the Director
of the General Political Bureau?

230
00:20:40,012 --> 00:20:43,766
What if it's complete bullshit
and we got fooled?

231
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:46,769
Shouldn't you know him better by now?
He'd never do that.

232
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:55,861
His father is the Director
of the General Political Bureau?

233
00:20:55,944 --> 00:20:58,155
That's right. My husband

234
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:01,450
heard his colleagues talk about it.

235
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,286
I have to say, there was

236
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:06,664
something different about him.

237
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:10,709
I mean, his looks alone are revolutionary.

238
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:13,128
And the way he talks and walks.

239
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:16,382
I always thought he looked
too confident for a captain.

240
00:21:16,465 --> 00:21:18,258
-Exactly.
-Yes, totally.

241
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:21,387
To be honest,
when I saw his broad shoulders,

242
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,847
I knew that he was special.

243
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:26,183
-His shoulders?
-Yes.

244
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:27,685
Think about it.

245
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:32,398
He can show off those broad shoulders
because someone's got his back.

246
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:37,027
If he'd ever been intimidated by anyone
since he was little,

247
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:40,906
he wouldn't have
such incredibly broad shoulders.

248
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,743
-She has a point.
-That's a good theory.

249
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:46,453
-Right?
-Good point.

250
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,455
DEMILITARIZED ZONE

251
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,332
<i>A deserter from Stakeout Squad 31.</i>

252
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:52,543
-<i>A deserter from Stakeout Squad 31.</i>
-It's an emergency!

253
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:55,295
-An emergency!
-<i>A deserter from Stakeout Squad 31.</i>

254
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:57,881
<i>A deserter from Stakeout Squad 31.</i>

255
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:00,175
<i>What? Another deserter?</i>

256
00:22:02,803 --> 00:22:05,681
Tell everyone to be on standby.
Where is Lieutenant Commander Cho?

257
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:08,058
Pyongyang?

258
00:22:08,142 --> 00:22:10,060
Why at this critical time?

259
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:11,311
"Spy education"?

260
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:13,355
Goodness. Fine.

261
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:18,736
-Could you prepare my dinner now?
-I heard about it.

262
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:19,820
About what?

263
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:22,698
Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok.

264
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:25,617
I heard he went to the detention center.

265
00:22:26,452 --> 00:22:29,538
Young people these days have no respect.

266
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:31,915
I mean, he defied his superior.
What was he thinking?

267
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:34,501
That punk won't be seeing
any sunlight for a while.

268
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,837
Have you ever wondered

269
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,467
why Captain Ri was being disrespectful?

270
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:44,803
It's because he's got no morals,
of course.

271
00:22:45,429 --> 00:22:47,431
He was the one who tipped off
the Trial Bureau,

272
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:49,892
which is why Cho Cheol Gang
and I were investigated.

273
00:22:49,975 --> 00:22:52,186
He kept digging around
and it was one hell of a headache.

274
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:55,189
Why do you think he's got so much nerve

275
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,776
to poke around, dig around,
and nose around?

276
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,361
You keep beating around the bush.

277
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:03,656
Just tell me what your point is.

278
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:06,408
Have you

279
00:23:06,992 --> 00:23:10,287
ever met the Director
of the General Political Bureau?

280
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,540
How can I meet such a high officer?

281
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,835
Why? Does anyone have the connection?

282
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,420
There was, indeed.

283
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:21,089
But someone just cut it off.

284
00:23:21,173 --> 00:23:23,217
Who did that?
What kind of a psycho would do that?

285
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:26,887
-It was you!
-Gosh! What's wrong?

286
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,972
Ri Jeong Hyeok was born
with the connection

287
00:23:29,056 --> 00:23:30,974
to the Director
of the General Political Bureau.

288
00:23:31,058 --> 00:23:33,143
What? How does he have the connection?

289
00:23:33,852 --> 00:23:37,064
Ri Jeong Hyeok is the son of the Director
of the General Political Bureau!

290
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:38,982
What?

291
00:23:40,692 --> 00:23:43,487
I told you to give him
the Preferential Star.

292
00:23:44,071 --> 00:23:45,656
But you just gave it to a random man.

293
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:46,865
What? He can't see sunlight?

294
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:49,535
Your life is never
going to see sunlight now.

295
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:51,662
What are you going to do now? Tell me!

296
00:23:51,745 --> 00:23:52,913
Where are you going?

297
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:10,222
Who are you?

298
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,516
What are you doing?

299
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,031
Have some tea.

300
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:40,294
It's pine mushroom tea.

301
00:24:41,044 --> 00:24:42,880
It smells good, and I appreciate it

302
00:24:44,756 --> 00:24:45,841
but I won't drink it.

303
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:48,886
It's not like
I was invited here as a guest.

304
00:24:48,969 --> 00:24:51,513
I won't just drink
whatever you tell me to drink.

305
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:52,848
I'm not that dumb.

306
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:54,725
Where do you think you are?

307
00:24:57,644 --> 00:24:59,980
You're her father, right?

308
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,025
You don't have to be surprised.

309
00:25:04,526 --> 00:25:07,154
You look just like Ms. Seo Dan.

310
00:25:08,989 --> 00:25:11,450
Your mouth, nose,

311
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:12,868
and especially

312
00:25:13,118 --> 00:25:15,621
your glaring eyes

313
00:25:15,704 --> 00:25:17,789
look just like hers.

314
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:19,875
-Is that so?
-Yes.

315
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:24,254
I'm quicker and more sensitive
than others at this kind of thing.

316
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:26,715
I see.

317
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:30,010
To be honest,
when I was first dragged here,

318
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:34,056
I was so upset
and wondered who would do this,

319
00:25:36,058 --> 00:25:38,393
but now I get it.

320
00:25:39,353 --> 00:25:40,479
You get it?

321
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:44,816
You think I'm in the way of your daughter.

322
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:48,487
You think I'm coming between the two,

323
00:25:49,738 --> 00:25:52,032
and I totally understand.

324
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:56,912
Okay. Then tell me.

325
00:25:57,496 --> 00:26:00,457
What was your purpose
of approaching Ri Jeong Hyeok

326
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,875
and staying with him?

327
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,463
"Purpose"? That's absolutely unfair.

328
00:26:06,546 --> 00:26:08,256
I am

329
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,801
a pure victim
of a second of the military gap

330
00:26:10,884 --> 00:26:13,720
created by a momentary error
of the defense system

331
00:26:13,971 --> 00:26:16,390
of the South and North Korea

332
00:26:16,473 --> 00:26:19,267
caused by a strong and unexpected storm.

333
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:22,813
-What?
-It was an accident.

334
00:26:24,856 --> 00:26:26,733
Sir, please think about it.

335
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:29,945
I'm running a company in South Korea.

336
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:33,073
It's not just a tiny store
but an enormous fashion company.

337
00:26:34,032 --> 00:26:37,703
This might sound like bragging,
but we have 14 branches abroad.

338
00:26:39,037 --> 00:26:41,248
So for what purpose would I come here

339
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:44,042
to put myself in trouble?

340
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:45,252
I am just

341
00:26:46,378 --> 00:26:49,506
an innocent citizen of Seoul
who has been worrying

342
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:52,384
about what I should do with all that money

343
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:57,180
and if I will ever get to use
all the money before I die.

344
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:02,894
And Ri Jeong Hyeok helped me
out of humanity.

345
00:27:03,562 --> 00:27:07,107
So are you saying
Ri Jeong Hyeok caused all this?

346
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:09,359
What? No.

347
00:27:09,651 --> 00:27:11,403
That's not what I meant.

348
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:13,947
He hasn't done anything wrong.

349
00:27:14,406 --> 00:27:16,408
I'm telling you.
He didn't do anything wrong.

350
00:27:16,908 --> 00:27:19,327
I want to make that clear at least.

351
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:20,579
He didn't do anything wrong?

352
00:27:20,912 --> 00:27:23,331
He hid an unidentified person
from South Korea.

353
00:27:23,415 --> 00:27:26,501
At first, he tried to report me.

354
00:27:26,585 --> 00:27:28,837
But I threatened him.

355
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,590
"If you report me, I will tell them

356
00:27:31,673 --> 00:27:34,051
you and your men did
a poor job at guarding."

357
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:36,678
So he had to make

358
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:39,806
an inevitable decision
for his subordinates.

359
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:43,894
So is that all about your relationship?

360
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:49,608
To be honest,

361
00:27:50,108 --> 00:27:51,526
I liked Ri Jeong Hyeok

362
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:53,862
a lot.

363
00:27:55,781 --> 00:27:58,700
It just happened. I'm so sorry.

364
00:27:58,825 --> 00:28:02,287
He didn't like me back though.
It was one-sided. You don't need to worry.

365
00:28:02,788 --> 00:28:05,415
He must be thinking
I'm back in my country now.

366
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:06,750
I'm sure he doesn't care at all.

367
00:28:08,418 --> 00:28:09,628
So, sir,

368
00:28:11,004 --> 00:28:12,339
please help me.

369
00:28:12,422 --> 00:28:13,256
Me?

370
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:16,426
You hired some men to kidnap me.

371
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:21,181
Obviously, you have some power.
That's why I'm asking.

372
00:28:22,307 --> 00:28:24,101
Please be generous

373
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:26,478
and help me go home in one piece.

374
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:30,732
Actually, you know,
Ri Jeong Hyeok is just a captain.

375
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,152
He doesn't have any power.

376
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:37,072
He doesn't have any power.

377
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:43,870
If you help me this time,

378
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:48,166
I promise to return your favor.

379
00:28:53,171 --> 00:28:54,172
Sir!

380
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:56,216
Sir!

381
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:57,884
Sir!

382
00:28:57,968 --> 00:28:59,136
Sir!

383
00:29:20,198 --> 00:29:21,241
Are you kidding me?

384
00:29:22,242 --> 00:29:24,327
I've been training myself
with intermittent fasting.

385
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:46,057
I won't swallow
a single grain of rice here.

386
00:29:46,641 --> 00:29:47,809
I'm sorry.

387
00:29:48,393 --> 00:29:49,895
You haven't eaten anything today.

388
00:29:51,855 --> 00:29:54,441
If you think the food is poisoned,
I can try it for you.

389
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:58,278
Who are you?

390
00:29:59,654 --> 00:30:00,697
Actually,

391
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:02,616
that doesn't matter.

392
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:04,618
Why did you bring me here?

393
00:30:05,202 --> 00:30:06,411
I'm sorry,

394
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:09,748
but we can't help it either.

395
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:13,418
The food is safe. You can eat it.

396
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:15,253
Wait.

397
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:17,881
Could you tell me

398
00:30:19,132 --> 00:30:20,133
if Ri Jeong Hyeok is...

399
00:30:25,847 --> 00:30:28,433
doing all right?

400
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,189
I don't want him to be in trouble

401
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:35,857
or be punished because of me.

402
00:30:36,024 --> 00:30:38,360
That's the last thing I want.

403
00:30:40,362 --> 00:30:42,405
Do you like him so much?

404
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:47,077
Well...

405
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,872
That's not it.

406
00:31:00,507 --> 00:31:02,801
It's unhealthy for a woman
to stay in a cold room like this.

407
00:31:22,654 --> 00:31:24,406
You should sleep here tonight.

408
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:25,949
By the way,

409
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:29,411
who is the owner of this room?

410
00:31:30,245 --> 00:31:32,372
I believe one's bookshelves

411
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:34,874
tell the person's personality,

412
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:37,669
character, and taste.

413
00:31:39,004 --> 00:31:40,922
And these books

414
00:31:41,548 --> 00:31:43,967
remind me of someone I know.

415
00:31:45,802 --> 00:31:49,014
Dan, what was the room number?

416
00:31:57,105 --> 00:31:58,606
You're not

417
00:31:59,566 --> 00:32:00,650
Seo Dan's mother, are you?

418
00:32:04,112 --> 00:32:07,115
Are you Jeong Hyeok's mother?

419
00:32:10,493 --> 00:32:12,662
THE DAUGHTER OF QUEENS
AND THE CEO OF SE-RI'S CHOICE DIES

420
00:32:12,746 --> 00:32:14,164
<i>MYEONGSEONG DAILY NEWS</i>

421
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:18,668
She's a daughter of a rich family
and was registered dead.

422
00:32:19,794 --> 00:32:22,464
Why on earth did she come here
and meet my son?

423
00:32:22,547 --> 00:32:24,424
You must not send her back.

424
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:28,094
If she goes back to South Korea,
it will create a big buzz.

425
00:32:28,595 --> 00:32:32,265
It will cause something
you need to take responsibility for.

426
00:32:33,016 --> 00:32:35,143
The Military Director seems
to be up to something too.

427
00:32:35,727 --> 00:32:36,770
We don't have enough time.

428
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:38,646
Just give me an order

429
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,359
and I will take her out tonight
and take care of her quietly.

430
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:47,530
Not at such a late hour.

431
00:32:48,114 --> 00:32:48,948
Excuse me, sir?

432
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:53,286
My wife keeps insisting that we should
let her get some sleep at least.

433
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,496
Oh, well.

434
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:59,709
Let's wait and see for now.

435
00:33:31,074 --> 00:33:33,910
Goodness, Jeong Hyeok.

436
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:37,163
Were you a child actor?

437
00:33:38,998 --> 00:33:42,001
You look so handsome among other kids.
That's just unfair.

438
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:51,553
Look at the handwriting.

439
00:33:52,804 --> 00:33:54,514
So cute.

440
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:05,483
I WANT TO BE A WORLD-FAMOUS PIANIST

441
00:34:05,567 --> 00:34:07,277
Did you want

442
00:34:08,278 --> 00:34:10,864
to become a pianist?

443
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:23,918
But...

444
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,963
you ended up being a soldier.

445
00:36:00,964 --> 00:36:02,178
Sir,

446
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:06,479
I can let you visit him,
but bailing is a whole different matter.

447
00:36:06,563 --> 00:36:08,356
You're the head of the detention center.

448
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:10,650
Bailing shouldn't be a big deal for you.

449
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:12,610
He assaulted his superior,

450
00:36:12,694 --> 00:36:14,362
who was Battalion Security Officer.

451
00:36:15,196 --> 00:36:16,823
It was the worst kind of mutiny.

452
00:36:17,532 --> 00:36:20,952
The State Security Department
is pretty upset about it.

453
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:25,707
You can't make it to the main position
if you're slow like that.

454
00:36:30,253 --> 00:36:32,005
Captain Ri's father is...

455
00:36:35,842 --> 00:36:39,596
My legs are still shaky.
I have no idea how I made it here.

456
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,725
As a matter of fact,
as the head of the detention center,

457
00:36:43,808 --> 00:36:47,937
I did have fundamental doubts
about whether it was an assault case.

458
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:51,733
-Right?
-An assault is

459
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:55,153
supposed to be done with this.

460
00:36:55,236 --> 00:36:58,072
It means to hit with a fist.

461
00:36:58,156 --> 00:36:59,532
Doesn't it mean to hit and beat?

462
00:36:59,616 --> 00:37:00,867
No.

463
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:04,203
It can be called an assault
only when someone is beaten by a fist.

464
00:37:04,537 --> 00:37:06,247
And?

465
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:12,170
It sounded like Captain Ri hit him
with his hand open.

466
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:15,256
That's what I heard, I believe.

467
00:37:16,382 --> 00:37:19,510
-Then it wasn't an assault.
-No, it wasn't.

468
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:24,557
Where's Ri Jeong Hyeok, the poor man
who is behind bars for no reason?

469
00:37:24,641 --> 00:37:26,017
I shall bring him with me.

470
00:37:26,517 --> 00:37:29,520
RUN AWAY AND YOU DIE!
LET'S BUILD A STRONG SOCIALIST COUNTRY

471
00:37:31,731 --> 00:37:34,317
I'm sure you have learned
some lessons from this.

472
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:35,860
First,

473
00:37:36,694 --> 00:37:39,405
all kinds of things can happen in life.

474
00:37:41,532 --> 00:37:44,243
Second, whenever that happens,

475
00:37:47,622 --> 00:37:48,915
come to me.

476
00:37:49,999 --> 00:37:52,710
You should have called me first.

477
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,171
You should correct your mistake, okay?

478
00:37:56,464 --> 00:37:57,715
Okay.

479
00:37:58,549 --> 00:38:02,220
All right. You've been through a lot.
So take a good rest for the next days.

480
00:38:02,303 --> 00:38:05,890
My wife said she prepared a feast.

481
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:07,433
So come to my place.

482
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:09,435
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

483
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:10,895
Okay.

484
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:12,522
What is it?

485
00:38:13,815 --> 00:38:15,108
Tell me.

486
00:38:17,193 --> 00:38:20,279
I'll put the white radish salad here
because it's his favorite.

487
00:38:20,363 --> 00:38:21,447
Come on.

488
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:23,074
Put it here.

489
00:38:23,157 --> 00:38:25,118
-Senior Colonel, you're back.
-Hi.

490
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:27,870
Oh, my. Welcome.

491
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,044
Why are you alone? Where is Jeong Hyeok?

492
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:38,548
I don't know.
He said he had to hurry somewhere.

493
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:43,010
By the way, he asked me for a weird favor.

494
00:38:44,262 --> 00:38:45,179
What favor?

495
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,243
Jeong Hyeok must have gotten
his cooking skills from you.

496
00:39:07,326 --> 00:39:08,703
Did Jeong Hyeok

497
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:10,872
make noodles for you?

498
00:39:10,955 --> 00:39:13,750
Yes, he made me great noodles

499
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,501
and nice coffee too.

500
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:23,342
He must have gotten
the kind heart from you.

501
00:39:27,472 --> 00:39:31,017
Jeong Hyeok, what do you think?
If you think it's too rushed...

502
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,603
It's an old promise.

503
00:39:34,145 --> 00:39:35,104
I must keep it.

504
00:39:38,775 --> 00:39:41,527
Jeong Hyeok used to be a sweet boy,

505
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:44,655
but he changed at some point.

506
00:39:46,532 --> 00:39:49,535
He has become cold
and wouldn't let anyone be with him.

507
00:39:51,412 --> 00:39:52,789
But you just said he's kind.

508
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:55,958
I'm glad to hear that.

509
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:23,736
Where is she?

510
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,904
Who?

511
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:26,405
You know who I'm talking about.

512
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:29,116
I know you took that woman.

513
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,078
-Where is she?
-Where should I hide?

514
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,289
Don't worry and just tell him
you don't know anything.

515
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,708
I have...

516
00:40:38,793 --> 00:40:41,754
troubled his life too much already.

517
00:40:42,588 --> 00:40:45,299
I don't want to see him again.

518
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,385
I will cry if I see him.

519
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:49,595
Is there

520
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:52,932
a basement or something?

521
00:40:57,311 --> 00:40:58,354
Is she

522
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,483
dead?

523
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:04,318
Did you kill her?

524
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:08,404
Tell me!

525
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:11,993
Do you not worry about your future?

526
00:41:12,076 --> 00:41:13,119
I do.

527
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:15,079
That's why I'm doing this.

528
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:18,207
I don't want to constantly
look back on this day

529
00:41:18,291 --> 00:41:20,459
and be regretful in the future.
That's why.

530
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:22,253
"I could've protected her
if I'd been faster.

531
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:24,797
I could have saved her
if I'd done a better job."

532
00:41:25,673 --> 00:41:27,550
I don't want to be thinking like that.

533
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,638
You know how miserable it is
to live a life like that.

534
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:39,395
Mu Hyeok.

535
00:41:51,407 --> 00:41:54,285
On my way back home,
I couldn't even breathe.

536
00:41:55,286 --> 00:41:57,288
I was worried
I might have put her in trouble.

537
00:41:57,872 --> 00:41:59,373
If something happens to her,

538
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:02,793
I'll be living in hell
until the day I die.

539
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:08,215
Breathe, Jeong Hyeok.

540
00:42:09,216 --> 00:42:10,718
Why can't you breathe?

541
00:42:12,178 --> 00:42:14,847
We can't let our son
live in a living hell.

542
00:42:25,316 --> 00:42:26,484
Jeong Hyeok.

543
00:42:27,568 --> 00:42:28,819
You talk well.

544
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,406
I have never seen you talk so much.

545
00:42:44,543 --> 00:42:46,295
What happened to your face?

546
00:42:47,004 --> 00:42:48,214
Did you get hurt again?

547
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:52,343
I'm okay.

548
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,804
You always say you're okay.

549
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:58,349
Who did this to you?

550
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:01,268
I'm sorry I'm late.

551
00:43:03,062 --> 00:43:04,230
Don't say that.

552
00:43:05,189 --> 00:43:06,524
I'm the one who is sorry.

553
00:43:07,692 --> 00:43:08,859
It's because of me.

554
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:12,655
I'm always the trouble.

555
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:14,865
You're not trouble.

556
00:43:16,283 --> 00:43:18,077
If only I hadn't come here...

557
00:43:19,328 --> 00:43:20,454
Don't say that.

558
00:43:21,872 --> 00:43:23,082
That's not true.

559
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:34,271
So...

560
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:38,789
Did yelling at my face
make you feel better?

561
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:46,275
You should apologize to your father.

562
00:43:48,076 --> 00:43:49,495
You are the one who caused trouble.

563
00:43:49,578 --> 00:43:52,206
You can't yell at your father like that.
That's just rude.

564
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:54,082
Are you siding with him now?

565
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:55,501
Are you proud of what you did?

566
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,321
No, that's not what I meant.

567
00:44:02,804 --> 00:44:05,010
If you had told me
that you found out about her--

568
00:44:05,093 --> 00:44:07,763
If I did, would you have let me see her?

569
00:44:08,388 --> 00:44:12,059
You're hiding that woman
and risking our family's safety!

570
00:44:13,602 --> 00:44:15,395
But it's all my fault.

571
00:44:15,729 --> 00:44:17,022
She didn't do anything wrong.

572
00:44:18,565 --> 00:44:21,360
But she said it's all her fault.

573
00:44:23,278 --> 00:44:24,738
She said she threatened you,

574
00:44:24,822 --> 00:44:27,407
so you couldn't report her
to the State Security Department.

575
00:44:27,491 --> 00:44:28,992
What...

576
00:44:29,493 --> 00:44:30,536
That's not true.

577
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:32,955
I didn't care about the threat.

578
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:35,624
It was my own decision not to report her.

579
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:39,503
Why?

580
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:41,463
I didn't want her to be hurt.

581
00:44:44,842 --> 00:44:46,635
I couldn't trust
the State Security Department.

582
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:49,263
Who knows
what would have happened to her in there?

583
00:44:49,847 --> 00:44:51,348
She could have been hurt, used,

584
00:44:52,432 --> 00:44:54,393
or disappeared into thin air.

585
00:44:55,185 --> 00:44:57,604
I wasn't sure
that was not going to happen.

586
00:44:58,188 --> 00:45:00,774
That's why I couldn't send her there.

587
00:45:03,585 --> 00:45:04,980
Jeong Hyeok.

588
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:09,324
Goodness.

589
00:45:09,408 --> 00:45:11,577
This is unbelievable.

590
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,536
Get out of my sight.

591
00:45:13,036 --> 00:45:13,912
Sure.

592
00:45:16,665 --> 00:45:20,294
We were in the middle of a meal.
Come and join us.

593
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:28,594
Jeez.

594
00:45:41,315 --> 00:45:43,775
Oh, this? I'm okay.

595
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:46,570
I got into a scuffle with guys
from the State Security Department.

596
00:45:47,279 --> 00:45:50,532
Even now, I can't go back
to the guest lodge. I'm in hotel now.

597
00:45:50,616 --> 00:45:51,867
I didn't ask.

598
00:45:54,703 --> 00:45:55,621
What did you order?

599
00:45:55,704 --> 00:45:58,582
I haven't eaten anything the whole day,
and I'm hungry.

600
00:46:12,554 --> 00:46:14,473
What's up? You're scaring me.

601
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:20,687
Do you know when I first met Jeong Hyeok?

602
00:46:22,731 --> 00:46:25,025
I don't, but I'm really not interested.

603
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:26,902
I mean it.
I didn't ask and I'm not interested.

604
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:29,112
It was when I was 17.

605
00:46:30,113 --> 00:46:30,989
We were

606
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:34,576
going to the same school.

607
00:46:37,871 --> 00:46:39,957
The right side isn't waxed well.

608
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,667
Rub harder.

609
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,085
-Rub harder.
-Rub harder.

610
00:46:43,251 --> 00:46:45,087
Isn't that Jeong Hyeok?

611
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,171
Where?

612
00:46:46,254 --> 00:46:48,632
-Where?
-You're in the middle of cleaning.

613
00:46:50,884 --> 00:46:52,552
You must see this.

614
00:46:52,636 --> 00:46:53,804
Hurry over.

615
00:46:55,097 --> 00:46:58,809
You can't see Jeong Hyeok
play basketball every day.

616
00:46:59,226 --> 00:47:00,686
Who is Jeong Hyeok?

617
00:47:00,769 --> 00:47:01,770
Don't you know him?

618
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:04,147
He got three grand prizes
at the National Art Competition

619
00:47:04,231 --> 00:47:06,900
and he's preparing
for the Tchaikovsky Competition now.

620
00:47:07,442 --> 00:47:08,819
That's awesome.

621
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:09,945
He's so cool.

622
00:47:19,621 --> 00:47:21,331
<i>Since then,</i>

623
00:47:22,582 --> 00:47:25,168
<i>I couldn't get him out of my head.</i>

624
00:47:35,595 --> 00:47:37,472
<i>Although we never talked to each other,</i>

625
00:47:38,306 --> 00:47:40,726
<i>I believed we knew each other.</i>

626
00:47:45,355 --> 00:47:47,357
<i>So our families arranged our engagement,</i>

627
00:47:51,445 --> 00:47:54,114
<i>and I excitedly flew to Switzerland,</i>

628
00:47:54,197 --> 00:47:56,074
<i>where Jeong Hyeok was studying.</i>

629
00:48:12,591 --> 00:48:13,967
-Bye.
-Bye.

630
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:35,518
Jeong Hyeok.

631
00:48:41,787 --> 00:48:43,789
Dan?

632
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:48,335
I heard about you from my father.

633
00:48:49,628 --> 00:48:51,671
-We went to Geumseong Middle--
-It's nice to meet you.

634
00:48:58,261 --> 00:48:59,596
Nice to meet you.

635
00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:04,763
<i>"Nice to meet you"?</i>

636
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:08,105
It wasn't his first time seeing me.

637
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:11,316
Even a street dog would recognize someone

638
00:49:11,399 --> 00:49:14,111
whom it passed by so many times.

639
00:49:17,656 --> 00:49:18,824
I knew him first.

640
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:22,744
I knew him before she got to know him.

641
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:26,206
I met him first and I liked him first.
Does that not matter?

642
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,751
You're a fool.

643
00:49:31,294 --> 00:49:33,130
Things like that don't matter at all.

644
00:49:37,843 --> 00:49:40,637
Hey, enough. How many shots did you have?

645
00:49:41,304 --> 00:49:43,181
Do I look drunk to you?

646
00:49:43,598 --> 00:49:44,850
Yes.

647
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:48,145
How did you know that, you punk?

648
00:49:49,062 --> 00:49:51,273
You're not that stupid after all.

649
00:49:52,232 --> 00:49:55,360
Ms. Seo, I can accept
that you talk down to me,

650
00:49:55,443 --> 00:49:57,279
-but you can't just cuss at me--
-Hey.

651
00:49:58,238 --> 00:50:00,448
-Yes?
-I can do whatever I want.

652
00:50:06,037 --> 00:50:08,123
I can't understand.

653
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:09,291
What do you mean?

654
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:12,195
Why doesn't Jeong Hyeok like
an attractive woman like you?

655
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:16,173
-What?
-Don't you ever cuss with that mouth.

656
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,550
That's just my type.

657
00:50:18,633 --> 00:50:20,093
You make my heart flutter.

658
00:50:20,177 --> 00:50:21,469
Now, enough.

659
00:50:22,971 --> 00:50:24,264
You have

660
00:50:25,308 --> 00:50:27,934
a good eye, don't you?

661
00:50:30,812 --> 00:50:32,063
You're not bad.

662
00:50:33,481 --> 00:50:34,816
Right? I'm not bad.

663
00:50:37,527 --> 00:50:39,362
What's the point though?

664
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,240
You were dumped by that woman.

665
00:50:43,158 --> 00:50:45,744
If you hadn't gotten dumped,

666
00:50:45,827 --> 00:50:47,204
things wouldn't have gone this bad.

667
00:50:47,287 --> 00:50:49,581
What are you saying? I wasn't dumped.

668
00:50:49,664 --> 00:50:50,957
You were the one...

669
00:50:51,041 --> 00:50:52,417
What?

670
00:50:58,882 --> 00:51:00,383
Who are you?

671
00:51:00,467 --> 00:51:02,427
-Please excuse me.
-Who are you?

672
00:51:03,803 --> 00:51:04,804
Hey.

673
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:06,640
You can sleep over.

674
00:51:06,765 --> 00:51:08,225
Are you out of your mind?

675
00:51:08,308 --> 00:51:09,601
Shut your mouth.

676
00:51:09,684 --> 00:51:11,102
The whole neighborhood is listening.

677
00:51:11,186 --> 00:51:13,104
Goodness!

678
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,909
I'm sure you just saw something.

679
00:51:26,493 --> 00:51:29,663
Yes, I did see something.

680
00:51:30,814 --> 00:51:33,750
I just don't remember what I saw.

681
00:51:33,959 --> 00:51:39,089
You probably won't want to remember it.

682
00:51:41,049 --> 00:51:43,051
By the way, I thought her fiancé

683
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:44,928
was a Captain at the frontline...

684
00:51:45,428 --> 00:51:47,931
I can't remember anything.

685
00:51:54,062 --> 00:51:55,397
Sleep over.

686
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:58,066
Goodness gracious.

687
00:51:58,608 --> 00:51:59,526
Wait.

688
00:52:00,068 --> 00:52:01,194
Oh, my.

689
00:52:01,945 --> 00:52:03,738
Oh, no.

690
00:52:04,197 --> 00:52:05,532
Oh, no.

691
00:52:05,615 --> 00:52:06,700
Oh, no.

692
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,077
Where did

693
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:10,954
the son of a bitch go?

694
00:52:20,755 --> 00:52:22,549
I need to exercise more.

695
00:52:23,008 --> 00:52:24,217
What?

696
00:52:29,514 --> 00:52:30,849
Yes, it's me.

697
00:52:32,976 --> 00:52:34,185
What?

698
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:43,236
What?

699
00:52:47,949 --> 00:52:49,200
Oh, it's you.

700
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:52,120
Who were you expecting?

701
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:54,122
I wasn't expecting anyone.

702
00:52:54,706 --> 00:52:58,543
Since I'm in someone else's room
and in someone else's house,

703
00:52:58,793 --> 00:53:01,004
I feel a bit anxious

704
00:53:01,338 --> 00:53:03,465
and uncomfortable.
So I couldn't sleep well.

705
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:05,175
You feel anxious and uncomfortable,

706
00:53:05,258 --> 00:53:07,260
so you played the piano
the whole night last night?

707
00:53:08,428 --> 00:53:09,721
Did your mother tell you?

708
00:53:11,431 --> 00:53:12,432
Well...

709
00:53:13,058 --> 00:53:16,728
I had a lot going on in my mind.

710
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:22,400
When I feel depressed,
I try to calm myself down with art.

711
00:53:22,484 --> 00:53:23,360
That's my habit.

712
00:53:30,501 --> 00:53:35,283
By the way, did you want
to become a pianist?

713
00:53:39,663 --> 00:53:43,238
I happened to learn
about the dream you had as a little boy.

714
00:53:45,507 --> 00:53:46,883
It's all in the past.

715
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:50,804
Then can I ask you one thing?

716
00:53:52,472 --> 00:53:54,349
This is what I played last night.

717
00:53:55,183 --> 00:53:56,962
Do you know what this song is?

718
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,867
I asked everyone
who has quite some knowledge of music,

719
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:14,661
but no one knew it.

720
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:29,788
How do you know this song?

721
00:54:30,093 --> 00:54:33,221
I heard someone playing it
when I was traveling in Switzerland.

722
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,724
I loved the song, so I memorized it.

723
00:54:36,808 --> 00:54:39,811
But I couldn't find whose song it was.

724
00:54:40,854 --> 00:54:42,147
It was

725
00:54:43,356 --> 00:54:46,234
a snowy place by a beautiful lake.

726
00:54:47,527 --> 00:54:49,070
What was it called?

727
00:54:49,946 --> 00:54:51,072
Iseltwald.

728
00:54:53,158 --> 00:54:54,576
Yes, that's the name of the place.

729
00:54:55,952 --> 00:54:58,380
How do you know that?

730
00:55:17,932 --> 00:55:19,184
This is the song.

731
00:55:20,101 --> 00:55:21,519
So you know it.

732
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,981
Who wrote this song?
What's the title of it?

733
00:55:27,275 --> 00:55:28,818
It was late afternoon.

734
00:55:29,861 --> 00:55:31,196
And the place was all misty.

735
00:55:32,864 --> 00:55:35,867
I was leaving Switzerland
after hearing about my brother's death.

736
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:39,746
What do you mean?

737
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:42,290
I wrote the song for my brother,

738
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:47,295
and I played it by the lake
for the first and the last time.

739
00:57:51,419 --> 00:57:52,629
Are you saying

740
00:57:54,297 --> 00:57:56,049
you are the person

741
00:57:57,216 --> 00:57:59,177
who was playing the song that day?

742
00:58:03,723 --> 00:58:04,891
How is this...

743
00:58:08,645 --> 00:58:09,937
I can't believe this.

744
00:58:11,481 --> 00:58:12,482
That day,

745
00:58:14,317 --> 00:58:16,235
I was really lonely.

746
00:58:18,154 --> 00:58:19,113
I truly

747
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:23,993
wished to die then.

748
00:58:25,244 --> 00:58:28,164
I wanted to go to a beautiful place

749
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,125
and quietly disappear

750
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:33,586
so I didn't trouble anybody.

751
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,631
That's why I went there.

752
00:58:40,468 --> 00:58:42,553
But you were...

753
00:58:45,682 --> 00:58:47,475
there.

754
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:51,938
Even when

755
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,484
you didn't know it,

756
00:58:58,569 --> 00:58:59,904
you saved my life.

757
00:59:03,995 --> 00:59:05,051
Listen to me carefully.

758
00:59:07,265 --> 00:59:08,215
Tomorrow,

759
00:59:09,122 --> 00:59:10,790
you will go back home.

760
00:59:45,158 --> 00:59:46,576
There was a suspicious car

761
00:59:46,659 --> 00:59:49,412
using a temporary license plate

762
00:59:49,495 --> 00:59:52,790
in the military village at that time,
so we tracked the car.

763
00:59:53,082 --> 00:59:55,752
And the car went toward Seojaegol
and then disappeared.

764
00:59:55,835 --> 00:59:58,337
That's where Director
of the General Political Bureau lives.

765
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:03,301
So let's say that woman went there
by that car.

766
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,781
Even so, we don't know
if she's still there.

767
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,680
They might have killed her already.

768
01:00:07,764 --> 01:00:11,058
The security officer working in Seojaegol

769
01:00:11,225 --> 01:00:13,978
happens to be my college friend,
so I did some research.

770
01:00:14,562 --> 01:00:18,316
I heard there were cars coming in,
but no cars have gone out yet.

771
01:00:22,787 --> 01:00:23,779
Sir.

772
01:00:24,739 --> 01:00:28,242
If you go there now,
you can catch something huge.

773
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,546
Present arms.

774
01:00:42,882 --> 01:00:45,259
The car behind this is with me.
Let it pass too.

775
01:00:45,343 --> 01:00:46,886
Yes, sir!

776
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:06,697
Hello, sir.

777
01:01:07,532 --> 01:01:09,659
I have something urgent
to discuss with you,

778
01:01:09,742 --> 01:01:11,619
and I'm in front of your house now.

779
01:01:12,203 --> 01:01:14,121
Do you have a moment?

780
01:01:16,374 --> 01:01:19,001
I'm sorry I came so suddenly, sir.

781
01:01:19,085 --> 01:01:21,045
I'm sure

782
01:01:21,254 --> 01:01:23,256
you have a good reason.

783
01:01:26,259 --> 01:01:28,135
We have met before, right?

784
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:30,221
Yes, sir.

785
01:01:30,304 --> 01:01:33,182
We briefly met at Ri Jeong Hyeok's ward.

786
01:01:34,183 --> 01:01:35,434
Right, we did.

787
01:01:35,518 --> 01:01:38,104
How did the two of you come together?

788
01:01:38,938 --> 01:01:40,022
He tipped me off

789
01:01:40,982 --> 01:01:44,569
about something strange.

790
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:47,969
"Tipped off"?

791
01:01:49,323 --> 01:01:51,993
He said a person wanted
by the State Security Department

792
01:01:52,076 --> 01:01:53,744
is hiding here.

793
01:01:53,828 --> 01:01:57,248
I'm not sure
whether I should believe him or not.

794
01:01:57,915 --> 01:01:58,958
Are you saying

795
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:02,211
you want to search my house or something?

796
01:02:02,295 --> 01:02:04,005
No way.

797
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:05,506
I wouldn't dare.

798
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:08,593
But if such a person is hiding here,

799
01:02:08,676 --> 01:02:11,262
that person might harm you.

800
01:02:11,387 --> 01:02:13,514
That would be terrible.

801
01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:17,685
Thanks for worrying about me.

802
01:02:21,284 --> 01:02:22,703
URGENT INVESTIGATION REQUEST

803
01:02:23,578 --> 01:02:26,873
This is an urgent investigation request
from the State Security Department.

804
01:02:26,957 --> 01:02:30,544
I'm afraid we will have to search
your house for a moment, sir.

805
01:02:31,128 --> 01:02:32,963
This is just for the sake of formality.

806
01:02:33,046 --> 01:02:35,007
Carry it out with utmost respect.

807
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:37,342
-Search.
-Yes, sir!

808
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,418
Unbelievable.

809
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:01,962
An emergency switch?

810
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:03,714
An emergency switch, for goodness' sake.

811
01:03:04,339 --> 01:03:07,176
I thought that the fact
Captain Ri is the son of

812
01:03:07,259 --> 01:03:10,387
Director of the General Political Bureau
might somehow benefit us too,

813
01:03:10,471 --> 01:03:12,264
as we're his subordinates.

814
01:03:12,347 --> 01:03:14,183
Benefit, my foot. This is just shocking.

815
01:03:14,592 --> 01:03:15,768
We were

816
01:03:16,018 --> 01:03:18,020
supposed to be on duty next spring.

817
01:03:18,103 --> 01:03:19,062
Hey.

818
01:03:19,791 --> 01:03:23,192
We all got fooled by Captain Ri's lies.

819
01:03:24,568 --> 01:03:26,069
Think about it.

820
01:03:26,695 --> 01:03:29,823
If he was actually the son of the Director
of the General Political Bureau,

821
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:33,327
why would he get shot on the street
and put behind bars?

822
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:36,872
He probably told us lies
based on his personal hope

823
01:03:36,955 --> 01:03:41,251
that in his afterlife,
he would like to be born as a son

824
01:03:41,335 --> 01:03:44,713
of the Director
of the General Political Bureau,

825
01:03:44,797 --> 01:03:47,007
and we all got fooled by it.

826
01:03:47,174 --> 01:03:49,968
Why aren't you saying anything?

827
01:03:53,514 --> 01:03:56,934
Is there something
you heard from Captain Ri?

828
01:03:59,144 --> 01:04:03,232
<i>So what favor
did Jeong Hyeok ask of the Senior Colonel?</i>

829
01:04:03,816 --> 01:04:06,610
Jeong Hyeok said to my husband...

830
01:04:07,361 --> 01:04:08,987
I would like to ask you for a favor.

831
01:04:10,172 --> 01:04:11,198
Okay.

832
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:12,825
What is it?

833
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:15,202
Tell me.

834
01:04:16,245 --> 01:04:19,331
I would like you to include my company
in the emergency switch.

835
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:22,543
But it's cold winter now.

836
01:04:22,668 --> 01:04:25,462
He asked him to deploy them
at the frontline?

837
01:04:25,546 --> 01:04:26,839
Frontline?

838
01:04:26,922 --> 01:04:30,634
Has he lost his mind
after his time in the detention center?

839
01:04:31,051 --> 01:04:32,673
Why would he ask that?

840
01:04:44,788 --> 01:04:48,068
<i>Captain Ri will go
to the frontline with Se-ri.</i>

841
01:04:48,277 --> 01:04:50,404
<i>That's why he asked
for the emergency switch.</i>

842
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,156
What? What do you mean?
Why do they go there?

843
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,325
She's going back to where she came from.

844
01:04:55,409 --> 01:04:57,160
But that doesn't make any...

845
01:04:57,244 --> 01:04:59,872
If he can bring her back in there somehow,

846
01:05:00,372 --> 01:05:02,541
it isn't complete nonsense.

847
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:04,668
I guess you're right.

848
01:05:05,127 --> 01:05:08,422
No others know that area better than us.

849
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:10,716
I mean, we guard the guard post too.

850
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,051
We search the area,

851
01:05:13,135 --> 01:05:15,721
and Captain Ri is the officer in charge.

852
01:05:15,804 --> 01:05:17,014
That area

853
01:05:17,097 --> 01:05:18,932
is our area.

854
01:05:32,854 --> 01:05:35,324
BORDER

855
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:41,204
DMZ NORTH ENTRANCE 1

856
01:06:12,778 --> 01:06:15,280
I am glad that you are looking out for me,

857
01:06:15,364 --> 01:06:17,366
but this should be enough.

858
01:06:17,783 --> 01:06:19,284
The sun will set soon.

859
01:06:19,868 --> 01:06:20,869
Of course.

860
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:24,623
It seems like I was given a false report.

861
01:06:27,852 --> 01:06:29,086
You punk.

862
01:06:29,169 --> 01:06:31,129
You scum!

863
01:06:31,463 --> 01:06:34,424
Do you know where we are right now?
What are you playing at?

864
01:06:34,508 --> 01:06:36,635
That's enough.

865
01:06:37,344 --> 01:06:39,513
Didn't Jeong Hyeok visit you?

866
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:41,640
Didn't he hide that woman?

867
01:06:41,723 --> 01:06:42,891
Hey!

868
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:47,145
It seems like you haven't heard the news.

869
01:06:47,729 --> 01:06:49,523
There has been an emergency company switch

870
01:06:49,606 --> 01:06:51,525
due to a deserter at the frontline.

871
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:56,113
My son should be at the frontline
right now as the captain of the company.

872
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:57,823
I had no idea.

873
01:06:58,407 --> 01:07:01,326
-I apologize for our discourtesy, sir.
-That's the place.

874
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:03,453
He went to the frontline

875
01:07:04,329 --> 01:07:07,457
-to send that woman to the south.
-Shut your mouth.

876
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:08,750
I know I am right.

877
01:07:08,834 --> 01:07:12,087
There is a chance they entered
the demilitarized zone.

878
01:07:14,089 --> 01:07:15,549
I apologize, sir.

879
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:17,801
I will take care of him.

880
01:07:18,658 --> 01:07:20,012
Drag him away.

881
01:07:21,555 --> 01:07:22,639
Sir.

882
01:08:04,695 --> 01:08:07,990
I didn't know there would be a village
in the demilitarized zone.

883
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:11,284
People lived here before the war.

884
01:08:11,868 --> 01:08:15,914
This house is in the best shape.

885
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:18,625
Come and sit down.

886
01:08:27,175 --> 01:08:28,343
All right.

887
01:08:29,761 --> 01:08:33,306
This isn't alcohol, but medicine.

888
01:08:34,516 --> 01:08:40,772
It must have been made before 1953--

889
01:08:40,856 --> 01:08:42,190
Master Sergeant Pyo.

890
01:08:43,275 --> 01:08:44,526
Yes, sir.

891
01:08:50,782 --> 01:08:54,202
Why is there a bowl on top of that crock?

892
01:08:55,412 --> 01:08:57,379
It's a bowl for fresh water.

893
01:08:58,165 --> 01:09:00,208
You mean the kind
that was used for prayer?

894
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:01,626
Yes.

895
01:09:03,086 --> 01:09:06,506
I think the person who lived here
had a son who went off to war.

896
01:09:09,176 --> 01:09:11,303
There are his photos in the room.

897
01:09:12,345 --> 01:09:16,016
We never touch one of those bowls.

898
01:09:16,975 --> 01:09:18,143
All of us have

899
01:09:19,561 --> 01:09:21,021
a mother.

900
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:29,696
Your mother will be happy
once you go back.

901
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:31,239
She must have waited for you.

902
01:09:35,494 --> 01:09:36,578
I don't know.

903
01:09:39,915 --> 01:09:41,124
Oh, you can see it from here.

904
01:09:42,292 --> 01:09:43,502
See what?

905
01:09:44,795 --> 01:09:47,047
Do you see that tiny mountain?

906
01:09:48,006 --> 01:09:49,716
-Yes.
-It's Mount Bukhan.

907
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,967
It's in Seoul, right?

908
01:09:51,676 --> 01:09:52,594
Really?

909
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:55,138
Is it so close?

910
01:09:55,764 --> 01:09:57,641
Even though it's so close,

911
01:09:58,767 --> 01:09:59,726
we won't

912
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,049
see each other again, right?

913
01:10:05,677 --> 01:10:06,650
Still,

914
01:10:07,192 --> 01:10:09,550
you will see your mother.

915
01:10:09,903 --> 01:10:11,279
I am jealous.

916
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,535
I am not that close with my mom.

917
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,790
You will be able to see your mom
after being discharged.

918
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:24,334
Are you making fun of him?

919
01:10:24,417 --> 01:10:27,254
He has nine years and seven months to go
before discharge.

920
01:10:27,337 --> 01:10:28,380
What?

921
01:10:28,964 --> 01:10:30,215
Nine years and seven months?

922
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,635
That's a long time.

923
01:10:35,053 --> 01:10:36,221
Eun Dong,

924
01:10:36,304 --> 01:10:38,056
you must miss your mom a lot.

925
01:10:39,099 --> 01:10:40,016
Yes.

926
01:10:41,768 --> 01:10:44,437
I miss her. I am worried about her.

927
01:10:46,106 --> 01:10:48,441
My hometown is colder than it is here.

928
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:50,819
I wonder if there is enough firewood.

929
01:10:51,361 --> 01:10:53,363
I wonder if my siblings are eating well.

930
01:10:54,114 --> 01:10:55,448
My youngest sibling

931
01:10:56,199 --> 01:10:57,450
is weak,

932
01:10:58,577 --> 01:11:00,078
so he gets sick often.

933
01:11:03,081 --> 01:11:04,541
I am sure all of them are doing well.

934
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:09,838
Everyone, don't get hurt.

935
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:12,591
Make sure you eat well.

936
01:11:12,966 --> 01:11:14,247
Stay healthy

937
01:11:17,387 --> 01:11:18,930
and live well, okay?

938
01:11:21,683 --> 01:11:22,991
You never know.

939
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:25,896
The two countries might suddenly reunify.

940
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:30,734
Stop talking nonsense.
Live well when you go home.

941
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:33,486
If you come back again, I will...

942
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:35,989
I will bury you

943
01:11:37,991 --> 01:11:38,825
at a mountain

944
01:11:39,492 --> 01:11:40,577
or a river.

945
01:11:43,288 --> 01:11:44,372
Suit yourself.

946
01:11:46,166 --> 01:11:48,376
Bury me at a mountain or a river.

947
01:11:51,963 --> 01:11:52,881
The sun

948
01:11:53,548 --> 01:11:55,550
should set already.

949
01:11:57,177 --> 01:12:00,680
That noisy woman can leave
only when it's dark.

950
01:12:14,715 --> 01:12:18,073
Mother, we need to call a locksmith.
There is no master key either.

951
01:12:24,746 --> 01:12:27,165
What brings you here?

952
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:28,750
Open the door.

953
01:12:37,926 --> 01:12:39,177
The passcode is my birthday.

954
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:42,889
The day I almost died.

955
01:12:52,941 --> 01:12:54,609
Mother, how did you know the passcode?

956
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,862
She is incredible.
How does she know everything?

957
01:12:57,946 --> 01:12:59,489
Maybe she can enter my house too.

958
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:01,157
Aren't you worried?

959
01:13:08,873 --> 01:13:10,500
My goodness.

960
01:13:11,001 --> 01:13:14,462
I wonder who had taken it
from the auction in Hong Kong.

961
01:13:14,546 --> 01:13:16,214
It was here.

962
01:13:33,815 --> 01:13:34,941
I prepared coffee.

963
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:38,194
Thank you.

964
01:13:44,993 --> 01:13:46,077
By the way,

965
01:13:47,078 --> 01:13:48,413
what brings you here?

966
01:13:50,832 --> 01:13:52,042
So you will list your company.

967
01:13:53,918 --> 01:13:57,213
You must know that
your brothers aren't doing so well.

968
01:13:58,757 --> 01:13:59,674
Must you

969
01:14:00,216 --> 01:14:01,176
do that?

970
01:14:02,844 --> 01:14:06,181
My brothers and my dad have nothing to do
with my company.

971
01:14:06,431 --> 01:14:09,392
I founded it and raised it.
Now, I will list it.

972
01:14:09,476 --> 01:14:10,560
Mom.

973
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:16,024
It wasn't easy to get this far by myself.
It was really hard.

974
01:14:18,568 --> 01:14:20,068
No one asked you to do that.

975
01:14:24,324 --> 01:14:26,926
I know exactly what you are playing at.

976
01:14:27,702 --> 01:14:29,496
You want your father to see it

977
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,749
and realize that
you are better than your brothers.

978
01:14:32,832 --> 01:14:35,585
You want to get chosen.
You want to take everything!

979
01:14:37,003 --> 01:14:38,880
-Mom.
-"Mom"?

980
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:41,883
If you let go of your greed,

981
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:44,844
we can have an easy relationship

982
01:14:44,928 --> 01:14:46,596
like a real mother and a daughter.

983
01:14:46,679 --> 01:14:47,931
It isn't greed.

984
01:14:49,307 --> 01:14:50,392
It's my dream.

985
01:14:51,518 --> 01:14:52,435
Do you think

986
01:14:52,894 --> 01:14:54,270
you deserve that luxury?

987
01:14:56,064 --> 01:14:57,190
Because of you,

988
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:00,318
my life is hell.

989
01:15:09,347 --> 01:15:10,495
My goodness.

990
01:15:12,372 --> 01:15:14,666
Mother, do you see this engraving?

991
01:15:15,375 --> 01:15:18,837
Designer Jean Merritt passed away
right after she signed an autograph.

992
01:15:19,504 --> 01:15:22,757
This is the bag, Mother. My goodness.

993
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:23,967
Put it down.

994
01:15:25,051 --> 01:15:26,344
-Okay.
-Come on out.

995
01:15:26,428 --> 01:15:28,721
-Right now?
-Yes.

996
01:15:36,354 --> 01:15:37,564
What are you doing?

997
01:15:39,774 --> 01:15:43,736
We need to merge or take over
Se-ri's Choice eventually.

998
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:45,238
These documents might help.

999
01:15:47,594 --> 01:15:50,326
EXCELLENT COMPANY AWARD
WOMAN CEO OF THE YEAR

1000
01:16:02,005 --> 01:16:04,466
Mother, isn't it you?

1001
01:16:05,049 --> 01:16:06,134
I think it is.

1002
01:16:37,707 --> 01:16:38,833
Take care.

1003
01:16:41,002 --> 01:16:43,880
Go back to your life
as if nothing had happened.

1004
01:16:46,216 --> 01:16:48,384
You are in no position to worry about me.

1005
01:16:48,801 --> 01:16:51,638
Don't worry about me. I will be okay.

1006
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:56,142
I have so much work waiting for me.
I will get used to my old life in no time.

1007
01:16:56,643 --> 01:17:01,189
As always,
I will earn and spend money well,

1008
01:17:01,773 --> 01:17:05,068
work diligently, and date men.

1009
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:10,323
"Date men"?

1010
01:17:12,367 --> 01:17:14,327
Should I not do that?

1011
01:17:15,537 --> 01:17:16,829
Well,

1012
01:17:18,039 --> 01:17:19,123
it's up to you.

1013
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,085
Didn't you say we should have

1014
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:24,462
a post-breakup condolence period?

1015
01:17:27,173 --> 01:17:29,074
I believe it was six months.

1016
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:34,223
I simply meant you should do it.

1017
01:17:34,973 --> 01:17:37,809
You told me to go back to my life.

1018
01:17:38,308 --> 01:17:40,436
I didn't tell you to go back to men.

1019
01:17:41,312 --> 01:17:44,357
You told me to do so
as if nothing had happened.

1020
01:17:45,316 --> 01:17:47,485
I didn't tell you to cozy up to men.

1021
01:17:51,698 --> 01:17:53,241
Is a period of six months

1022
01:17:53,741 --> 01:17:54,576
enough?

1023
01:17:58,162 --> 01:17:59,414
Sure.

1024
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,042
Okay.

1025
01:18:03,876 --> 01:18:05,295
For six months,

1026
01:18:06,963 --> 01:18:08,840
I will have a condolence period.

1027
01:18:12,135 --> 01:18:13,511
It was fate.

1028
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:15,847
Think about it.

1029
01:18:16,252 --> 01:18:19,225
It's incredible
that we met by chance in Switzerland

1030
01:18:20,018 --> 01:18:22,729
and then in North Korea.

1031
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:27,275
What is it?

1032
01:18:34,532 --> 01:18:36,075
You can date men

1033
01:18:37,994 --> 01:18:41,414
and hang out with other people
as if nothing had happened.

1034
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,209
But

1035
01:18:47,003 --> 01:18:48,338
don't be lonely again.

1036
01:18:50,465 --> 01:18:54,886
Don't ever think about disappearing
at a scenic place.

1037
01:18:58,473 --> 01:18:59,599
You have me.

1038
01:19:00,933 --> 01:19:02,602
You won't be by my side.

1039
01:19:04,937 --> 01:19:06,272
I won't be by your side,

1040
01:19:08,316 --> 01:19:10,485
but I will always hope

1041
01:19:12,362 --> 01:19:13,529
that you won't be lonely.

1042
01:19:18,534 --> 01:19:19,619
Be happy

1043
01:19:20,703 --> 01:19:21,788
until the end of your life.

1044
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:26,501
I would be grateful if you do that.

1045
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,549
How do you

1046
01:19:34,092 --> 01:19:35,885
reach the border from here?

1047
01:19:38,221 --> 01:19:42,058
If you go that way,
you reach Yeokgok Stream.

1048
01:19:46,896 --> 01:19:48,861
<i>There is a small boat.</i>

1049
01:19:50,024 --> 01:19:54,737
<i>People hid it to catch fish with grenades
when the water level rises.</i>

1050
01:20:24,976 --> 01:20:26,436
<i>Then comes a mine-free path.</i>

1051
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:29,272
<i>It's marked</i>

1052
01:20:29,522 --> 01:20:32,442
<i>with square granite rocks
that are about 40cm tall.</i>

1053
01:20:34,402 --> 01:20:38,990
<i>There are no mines within the 10m radius.</i>

1054
01:20:42,493 --> 01:20:47,165
<i>If you walk down that path,
you will reach the Southern Limit Line.</i>

1055
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:51,878
-It's not far from here.
-That's right.

1056
01:20:52,462 --> 01:20:55,616
A round trip should take
about an hour or two...

1057
01:21:01,053 --> 01:21:02,972
The hour is...

1058
01:21:03,765 --> 01:21:05,266
Dawn will break soon.

1059
01:21:05,349 --> 01:21:06,809
Why isn't he back yet?

1060
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:09,061
Maybe he got lost.

1061
01:21:09,687 --> 01:21:11,230
No way.

1062
01:21:21,407 --> 01:21:22,700
What is it?

1063
01:21:25,161 --> 01:21:26,579
This is a wrong path.

1064
01:21:27,455 --> 01:21:28,456
Again?

1065
01:21:30,041 --> 01:21:31,292
We keep finding the wrong path.

1066
01:21:36,464 --> 01:21:38,257
I think I saw that place before.

1067
01:21:43,012 --> 01:21:45,765
The paths look alike, so...

1068
01:21:45,848 --> 01:21:47,058
Ri Jeong Hyeok.

1069
01:21:48,184 --> 01:21:49,412
Be honest with me.

1070
01:21:50,436 --> 01:21:52,688
-What?
-You have no sense of direction, right?

1071
01:21:53,356 --> 01:21:57,151
<i>Among us, Captain Ri is the best
at finding the right direction</i>

1072
01:21:57,235 --> 01:21:58,986
<i>even in the dark.</i>

1073
01:21:59,070 --> 01:21:59,904
Yes.

1074
01:22:01,447 --> 01:22:04,075
I am bad at finding the right direction

1075
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,578
in the dark.

1076
01:22:10,164 --> 01:22:11,207
I am sorry.

1077
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:18,840
The fact he hasn't come back yet means

1078
01:22:19,924 --> 01:22:22,593
he has either gotten into an accident...

1079
01:22:22,677 --> 01:22:23,845
-What?
-What?

1080
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,264
Or he wants to spend more time

1081
01:22:27,014 --> 01:22:28,391
with her.

1082
01:22:29,308 --> 01:22:30,726
-Right.
-I see.

1083
01:22:53,124 --> 01:22:54,208
We are here.

1084
01:22:59,755 --> 01:23:02,216
We are finally here.

1085
01:23:05,428 --> 01:23:07,054
Do you see that tree over there?

1086
01:23:12,602 --> 01:23:14,562
Walk toward that tree.

1087
01:23:14,937 --> 01:23:18,232
That's the entrance
of the South Korean search team.

1088
01:23:20,693 --> 01:23:23,112
The search team will do a round
in the morning,

1089
01:23:23,195 --> 01:23:24,530
so ask them for help.

1090
01:23:27,783 --> 01:23:28,784
By any chance,

1091
01:23:30,786 --> 01:23:33,706
can you walk me there?

1092
01:23:37,251 --> 01:23:38,836
I can't take a single step

1093
01:23:39,378 --> 01:23:40,588
over this line.

1094
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:52,016
Don't forget to keep your eyes
on the rocks.

1095
01:23:59,607 --> 01:24:00,775
Jeong Hyeok,

1096
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:03,235
don't forget about me.

1097
01:24:05,154 --> 01:24:05,988
I won't.

1098
01:24:06,072 --> 01:24:10,117
How would I forget about a woman
who fell from the sky?

1099
01:24:11,911 --> 01:24:13,496
I didn't fall.

1100
01:24:13,579 --> 01:24:14,538
I descended.

1101
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:17,875
Sure.

1102
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:27,301
I will get going now.

1103
01:25:24,358 --> 01:25:25,568
A single step

1104
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:29,113
should be okay.

1105
01:26:40,142 --> 01:26:42,436
I can't believe him.

1106
01:26:43,187 --> 01:26:47,691
All the books are dark and difficult.

1107
01:27:38,742 --> 01:27:41,287
I LOVE YOU

1108
01:27:43,789 --> 01:27:46,667
RI JEONG HYEOK

1109
01:27:49,295 --> 01:27:54,175
I LOVE YOU RI JEONG HYEOK

1110
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:05,226
